### 5.4.1. Stream Elements

Stream specifications identify resources necessary for processing content of CSV files and messaging system. An STR is a CSV file itself composed of one row of data (i.e., a record) composed of the following eight fields (columns):

Column Header   | Column Description
--------------- | ------------------
Study ID        | study 
da name         | a name-template for selecting incoming files or the IP address of a messaging broadcaster 
data dict       | the data dictionary of choice for processing the file(s)
deployment uri  | URI of deployment originating data file's content 
cell scope      | cell level scope (see explanation below in this section)
owner email     | the email address of the person who is the actual owner of the data 
permission url  | permission policy for accessing the data

__Study ID__: The URI of the study associated with the STR

__da name__: An STR file identifies a common ‘prefix’ that is assigned to a given collection of data files that are going to have the same owner, same study, and most important, be ingested using a common SDD. For instance, let say that we have files named "File1.csv" and "File2.csv", and that both files need to be ingested using SDD-ABC.xls. In this case, we can do all the following: 
* Create an STR file with __da name__=‘Z’ and __data dict__='SDD-ABC';
* Rename File1.csv to "DA-Z-1.csv";
* Rename File2 to  "DA-Z-2.csv";
* Submit SDD-ABC.xls for ingestion;
* Submit DA-Z-1.csv for ingestion;
* Submit DA-Z-2.csv for ingestion.

__data dict__: The data dictionary of the STR identifies the SDD document that describes how objects identified during the parsing of the SDD file content map to object types. The precise identification of which object is mapped to each value is specified by the row-scope attribute and cell-scope attribute described below. 

__deployment uri__:The URI of a deployment(specified in a DPL file)

__cell Scope__: Objects associated with a data file need to be either instantiated in HADatAc's knowledge base or they need to be objects created during the ingestion of a file with the use of an SDD that specifies dynamic objets. The cell scope is used when objects in a single row belong to multiple objects that are not associated with each other through known semantic relationships, for instance, when a single row have information from two or more subjects instead of a single objects. If all the attributes of interest in a given file come from a single object, and one of the cells of the row is the identifier of the object, there is no need to specify a cell scope (that can be left blank).

__owner email__: Email of a registered user who is going to be assigned of the content extracted from the file that is going to be ingested

### 5.4.2. An STR Example

Let assume that we have three files names DA-demographics001.csv, DA-demographics002.csv and DA-demographics003.csv, that the three files need to be processed by a common SDD named SDD-demographics.xsl, and that the data files are related to a common set of objects. Under these assumptions, one STR file can be used to assign how content extracted from the files will be assigned to the common set of objects. 

Study ID  | da name      | data dict        | deployment uri | cell scope | owner email     | permission uri
--------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------
2016-1234 | demographics | SDD-demographics | proj:quest     |            | joe@example.org | http://example\#team

The table above shows an example of how a semantic dada dictionary SDD-demographics is assigned to parse the content of the file starting with the name __DA-demographics__. In fact, the STR specification assumes that any data file name starts with __DA-__ plus the data-file-name value in the STR.  

The STR above further specifies that joe@example.org is the email of the owner of the data content of any file that starts with the name __DA-demographics__, and that anyone with permission __http://example#team__ (according to HADatAc's data access policy) has access to content extracted from any file matching the data-file-name identified in the STR.
