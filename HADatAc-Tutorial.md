This tutorial guides new HADatAc users through the execution of eleven tasks that shows how the framework handles data and its metadata, and how the framework may help these users to manage and take advantage of integrated, combined collections of data and metadata.

## 1. Registering as a Data Owner

When initially installed, HADatAc grants the first user who signs up with administrative permission. 

If you are not the first user to register, you need to find this first user and ask s/he to pre-register you into the systems. The pre-registration is done in the user management option available to users with administrative permission.

Once you are pre-registered, which may be confirmed by the administrator who can use HADatAc to send you an invitation email, you can sign up for HADatAc. Please note that you will need to provide an email address, which must be the exact email address that is pre-registered in the system.
