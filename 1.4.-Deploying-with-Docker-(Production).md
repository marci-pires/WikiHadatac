A basic HADatAc installation involves the following steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console

* downloading HADatAc code from this GitHub repository 

* deploying HADatAc

## Step 1 : Acquiring Required Software

Before anything, however, we need to verify that the host machine has a `git client` to retrieve the code. In the command line of your machine, verify that you have a `git` client installed in your machine:

    git
 
If you do not have git, you need to install one: http://git-scm.com/downloads. 

Install a Docker Community Edition that can be downloaded from [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Docker is available for many operating systems as listed in the link above.

Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started with Docker.

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc Code

The commands in this section are to be issued by root user

Create both /data and /data/git folders:

      mkdir -p /data/git

Go to git directory :

      cd /data/git

Once your are in your home directory (`~` is a shortcut for your home directory), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

     cd /data/git/hadatac

## Step 3: Changing configuration files

The various HADatAc configuration files need to be changed before you build it with Docker. After you build the hadatac service, though, you can edit the configuration files inside of the container and restart the service.

The following configuration files in particular, need to be changed to suit your needs:

* `conf/hadatac-docker.conf` - The base_url should be changed to the domain name where HADatAc is being deployed. Also, the community settings (at the bottom of the file) should be adjusted to your needs. Particularly, the ont_prefix setting should be properly set.
* `conf/autoccsv-docker.config` - The template_file_name setting should be set to the template file you plan to use for CSV header mapping.
* `conf/play-authenticate/smtp.conf` - The SMTP setting should be set properly to allow for sending registration emails.

Read [this section](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration) for more information about the configuration files.

## Step 4: Deploying HADatAc

In HADatAc's home directory type the following:

     docker-compose build

Followed by the following command:

     docker-compose up -d 

If you are running it locally, you can go to `http://localhost:9000/hadatac` and see the running HADatAc instance. If you deployed it on another machine, you can access `http://(domain):9000/hadatac`, where `(domain)` is the name of the domain where you deployed it.

## Stopping HADatAc

To stop all of the HADatAc services deployed with Docker i.e. Blazegraph, Solr and the Play application, type `docker-compose stop`.

To tear down the services e.g. to completely remove the containers, type `docker-compose down`. This will still keep in place the various Docker Volumes that were attached to the Docker Containers. The volumes include a volume containing the Solr data, the Blazegraph data, the HADatAc configuration directory, and the directory containing all of the CSV files.

By keeping these volumes in tact, you can re-build HADatAc without losing any of the data already ingested. However, if you wish to completely remove the HADatAc instance, you can type `docker-compose down -v` and all of the volumes will be destroyed as well.

## Re-building HADatAc

If changes are made to HADatAc, you will want to re-compile the source code inside of the Docker Container. To do this, you simply run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This will remove the old HADatAc containers, re-build them and then bring them back up. No data or configuration file changes will be lost though, since those are stored in Docker Volumes as previously discussed.

# Useful Docker Commands

## Viewing Log Files

To view the logs files of the HADatAc play app, you can type `docker-compose logs hadatac`. If you wish to attach to the logs and see log messages as they are produced, you can type `docker-compose logs -f hadatac`.

To view Solr or Blazegraph logs, you can type `docker-compose logs solr` and `docker-compose logs blazegraph`, respectively.

## Accessing the Bash Terminal of the HADatAc Container

To access a Bash terminal of the Docker Container that is running the HADatAc Play application, you can type `docker-compose exec hadatac bash` (make sure it is running first with `docker-compose up -d`). This will bring you into a Bash terminal inside of the container in the directory where the application code is stored.

## Editing HADatAc Configuration Files in Built/Running Container

In order to edit the various configuration files of an already built HADatAc Docker instance, you will need to first run HADatAc and access the Bash terminal as described above.

Once you are inside of the container and at the Bash terminal, you can type `cd conf` and then `vi <config filename>` to access the vi text editor and edit a given configuration file. Just make sure to save any changes you make to a configuration files.

Because the configuration files are stored inside of a Docker Volume, the `conf` directory is independent of the HADatAc Docker container. So, if you tear down the containers with `docker-compose down`, the `conf` directory will still be present with any changes you may have made. Then, when you re-build and bring the HADatAc Docker container back up with `docker-compose down && docker-compose build`, the previous `conf` Docker volume will be attached to the `conf` directory inside of the new container, with any changes you made still present.
