## How Streams are created

There are two ways of creating a data stream: 

* by using the __Create New Stream__ button under Manage Stream (HOME > Manage Stream) or 
* by writing an STR file as described in [Section 5.4](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.4.-Stream-Specification-(STR)) and manually submitting the STR file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-data-file-ingest). 

## Stream management operations

The stream management option supports the following operations in addition to the create new stream mentioned above: 

* to list existing streams
* to list past streams
* to pause/resume a stream
* to permanently close a stream
* to change the permission of who has access to the stream's data

## What is a Stream

A __data stream__ can be a __data file stream__ or a __data message stream__. These are the properties of a data stream properties: 

* a DA Name Pattern (for file streams) or IP address (for message streams)
* a semantic data dictionary
* a scope (optional)
* a start date/time
* a end date/time, if no longer active,
* an owner, and
* a data access level.

The status and number of documents associated with a stream are also properties of a stream that are dynamically managed by the HADatAc infrastructure.
