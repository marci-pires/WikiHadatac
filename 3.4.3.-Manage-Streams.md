This option is used to manage the collection of data streams in use within the infrastructure. Initial specification of streams are done withe use of STR metadata files as described in Section . 

A __data stream__ can be a __data file stream__ or a __data message stream__. These are the properties of a data stream properties: 

* a DA Name Pattern (for file streams) or IP address (for message streams)
* a semantic data dictionary
* a scope (optional)
* a start date/time
* a end date/time, if no longer active,
* an owner, and
* a data access level.

The status and number of documents associated with a stream are also properties of a stream that are dynamically managed by the HADatAc infrastructure.
