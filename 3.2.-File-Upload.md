## Data Uploading Vs. Data Ingestion

HADatAc calls _data uploading_ the process of adding data files into the framework, and _data ingestion_ the process of processing uploaded data file contents into the framework's databases. 

It is important to note that any kind of data file can be uploaded into HADatAc, but only files that meet the following criteria are ingested into HADatAc: 

* files that are associated with data acquisitions; and 
* files that are in CSV or Excel formats a (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). 

Files can be manually or automatically associated with data acquisitions. The manual process of assigning a file to a data acquisition in described in [Section 3.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.3.-Data-Preparation-and-Ingestion). 

## Manual Data File Upload

Manual data file upload is done by going to __Home > Manage Data Files__.

The screenshot above shows the __Manage Data Files__ user interface, showing three distinct areas. 

* drop file area
* processed files folder
* unprocessed files folder

Data files are manually uploaded into HADatAc by dragging and dropping files into the grey drop file area. Once files are uploaded, they will show up in the unprocessed files folder. For instance, the __DA-CBIS-Feb-2017-DMG-B-3.csv__ in the image above was uploaded into HADatAc, and it is now assigned to a user who can leave the datafile there or may decide to share, download or even delete the file. Once files are uploaded, they can either be automatically ingested in case they are associated to a data acquisition as explained above. 

## Automatic Data File Upload

The process of uploading files into HADatAc can also be accomplished programatically. In this case, the code or script responsible for uploading new data files into HADatAc needs to have permission to write files into the __unprocessed csv__ folder of HADatAc.

The exact location of (unprocessed and processed) files uploaded in HADatAc is defined in the autoccsv.config file (as described in [Section 2.1.4](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#214-setting-up-autoccsvconfig)).
