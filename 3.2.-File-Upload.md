HADatAc calls _data uploading_ the process of adding data files into the framework, and _data ingestion_ the process of processing uploaded data file contents into the framework's databases. Any kind of data file can be uploaded into HADatAc, but only files that are associated with data acquisitions and are in CSV or Excel format are capable of being ingested (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). Files can be manually or automatically associated with data acquisitions. The manual process of assigning a file to a data acquisition in described in [Section 3.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.3.-Data-Preparation-and-Ingestion). The automatic process of assigning a file to a a data acquisition is described in Section X.

The screenshot above shows how data files can be uploaded into HADatAc in ways very similar to other well established cloud-based online repositories like Dropbox and Google drive. For instance, the “DA-CBIS-Feb-2017-DMG-B-3.csv” file, which is a data file, was uploaded into the infrastructure and now it is assigned to a user who can leave the datafile there or may decide to share, download or even delete the file. 

Once files are uploaded, they can either be automatically ingested in case the infrastructure’s knowledge base knows how to process the file, or may guide scientists in the process of telling the system how to ingest the data.
