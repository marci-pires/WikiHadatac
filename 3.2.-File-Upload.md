## Data Uploading Vs. Data Ingestion

HADatAc calls _data uploading_ the process of adding data files into the framework, and _data ingestion_ the process of processing uploaded data file contents into the framework's databases. 

It is important to note that any kind of data file can be uploaded into HADatAc, but only files that meet the following criteria are ingested into HADatAc: 

* files that are associated with data acquisitions; and 
* files that are in CSV or Excel formats a (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). 

Files can be manually or automatically associated with data acquisitions. The manual process of assigning a file to a data acquisition in described in [Section 3.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.3.-Data-Preparation-and-Ingestion). 

## Automatic Data File Upload

The process of uploading files into HADatAc can also be accomplished programatically. In this case, the code or script responsible for uploading new data files into HADatAc needs to have permission to write files into the __unprocessed csv__ folder of HADatAc.

The exact location of (unprocessed and processed) files uploaded in HADatAc is defined in the autoccsv.config file (as described in [Section 2.1.4](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#214-setting-up-autoccsvconfig)).
