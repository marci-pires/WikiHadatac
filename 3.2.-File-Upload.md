## Data Uploading Vs. Data Ingestion

HADatAc calls _data uploading_ the process of adding data files into the framework, and _data ingestion_ the process of processing uploaded data file contents into the framework's databases. 

It is important to note that any kind of data file can be uploaded into HADatAc, but only files that meet the following criteria are ingested into HADatAc: 

* files that are associated with data acquisitions; and 
* files that are in CSV or Excel formats a (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). 

Files can be manually or automatically associated with data acquisitions. The manual process of assigning a file to a data acquisition in described in [Section 3.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.3.-Data-Preparation-and-Ingestion). The automatic process of assigning a file to a a data acquisition is described in [Section 4.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#432-object-access-specification-oas).   

## Manual Data File Upload

The screenshot above shows how data files can be uploaded into HADatAc in ways very similar to other well established cloud-based online repositories like Dropbox and Google drive. For instance, the “DA-CBIS-Feb-2017-DMG-B-3.csv” file, which is a data file, was uploaded into the infrastructure and now it is assigned to a user who can leave the datafile there or may decide to share, download or even delete the file. 

Once files are uploaded, they can either be automatically ingested in case the infrastructure’s knowledge base knows how to process the file, or may guide scientists in the process of telling the system how to ingest the data.
