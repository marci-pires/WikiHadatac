A basic HADatAc installation involves the following steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console

* downloading HADatAc code from this GitHub repository 

* deploying HADatAc

## Step 1 : Acquiring Required Software

Before anything, however, we need to verify that the host machine has a `git client` to retrieve the code. In the command line of your machine, verify that you have a `git` client installed in your machine:

    git
 
If you do not have git, you need to install one: http://git-scm.com/downloads. 

Install a Docker Community Edition that can be downloaded from [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Docker is available for many operating systems as listed in the link above.

Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started with Docker.

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc Code

The commands in this section are to be issued by root user

Create both /data and /data/git folders:

      mkdir -p /data/git

Go to git directory :

      cd /data/git

Once your are in your home directory (`~` is a shortcut for your home directory), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

     cd /data/git/hadatac

## Step 3: Changing configuration files

The various HADatAc configuration files need to be changed before you build it with Docker. After you build the hadatac service, though, you can edit the configuration files inside of the container and restart the service.

The following configuration files in particular, need to be changed to suit your needs:

* `conf/hadatac-docker.conf` - The base_url should be changed to the domain name where HADatAc is being deployed. Also, the community settings (at the bottom of the file) should be adjusted to your needs. Particularly, the ont_prefix setting should be properly set.
* `conf/autoccsv-docker.config` - The template_file_name setting should be set to the template file you plan to use for CSV header mapping.
* `conf/play-authenticate/smtp.conf` - The SMTP setting should be set properly to allow for sending registration emails.

Read [this section](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration) for more information about the configuration files.

## Step 4: Deploying HADatAc

In HADatAc's home directory type the following:

     docker-compose build

Followed by the following command:

     docker-compose up -d 

If you are running it locally, you can go to `http://localhost:9000/hadatac` and see the running HADatAc instance. If you deployed it on another machine, you can access `http://(domain):9000/hadatac`, where `(domain)` is the name of the domain where you deployed it.

## Stopping HADatAc

To stop all of the HADatAc services deployed with Docker i.e. Blazegraph, Solr and the Play application, type `docker-compose stop`.

To tear down the services e.g. to completely remove the containers, type `docker-compose down`. This will still keep in place the various Docker Volumes that were attached to the Docker Containers. The volumes include a volume containing the Solr data, the Blazegraph data, the HADatAc configuration directory, and the directory containing all of the CSV files.

By keeping these volumes in tact, you can re-build HADatAc without losing any of the data already ingested. However, if you wish to completely remove the HADatAc instance, you can type `docker-compose down -v` and all of the volumes will be destroyed as well.

## Re-building HADatAc

If changes are made to HADatAc, you will want to re-compile the source code inside of the Docker Container. To do this, you simply run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This will remove the old HADatAc containers, re-build them and then bring them back up. No data or configuration file changes will be lost though, since those are stored in Docker Volumes as previously discussed.

# Developing HADatAc with Docker

If you are developing HADatAc, you can also use Docker. Just run the commands above on your local machine, but use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file as well when issuing `docker-compose` commands. 

For example, to build and start HADatAc for the purposes of development, you would run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

The development Docker Compose file includes an additional Docker Volume that maps the `app` directory on your local machine to the `app` directory inside of the Docker container. This way, whenever you edit any files inside of that directory, they will automatically be changed inside of the Docker container as well. And, since HADatAc is already setup to allow for automatic change detection, once you have it running and make changes, all you have to do is refresh the page to see the changes.

# Useful Docker Commands for Deployment and Development

## Viewing Log Files

To view the logs files of the HADatAc play app, you can type `docker-compose logs hadatac`. If you wish to attach to the logs and see log messages as they are produced, you can type `docker-compose logs -f hadatac`. If you are developing HADatAc, you should use `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml` instead of `docker-compose` when typing the commands.
