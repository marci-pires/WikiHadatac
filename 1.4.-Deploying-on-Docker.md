A basic HADatAc installation involves the following steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console

* downloading HADatAc code from this GitHub repository 

* deploying HADatAc

## Step 1 : Acquiring Required Software

Before anything, however, we need to verify that the host machine has a `git client` to retrieve the code. In the command line of your machine, verify that you have a `git` client installed in your machine:

    git
 
If you do not have git, you need to install one: http://git-scm.com/downloads. 

Install a Docker Community Edition that can be downloaded from [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Docker is available for many operating systems as listed in the link above.

Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started with Docker.

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc Code

The commands in this section are to be issued by root user

Create both /data and /data/git folders:

      mkdir -p /data/git

Go to git directory :

      cd /data/git

Once your are in your home directory (`~` is a shortcut for your home directory), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

     cd /data/git/hadatac

## Step 3: Changing configuration files

The various HADatAc configuration files need to be changed before you build it with Docker.

The following configuration files need to be changed to suit your needs:

* `conf/hadatac-docker.conf` - The base_url should be changed to the domain name where HADatAc is being deployed. Also, the community settings (at the bottom of the file) should be adjusted to your needs. Particularly, the ont_prefix setting should be properly set.
* `conf/autoccsv-docker.config` - The template_file_name setting should be set to the template file you plan to use for CSV header mapping.
* `conf/play-authenticate/smtp.conf` - The SMTP setting should be set properly to allow for sending registration emails.

## Step 4: Deploying HADatAc

In HADatAc's home directory type the following:

     docker-compose build

Followed by the following command:

     docker-compose up -d 

If you are running it locally, you can go to `http://localhost:9000/hadatac` and see the running HADatAc instance. If you deployed it on another machine, you can access `http://(domain):9000/hadatac`, where `(domain)` is the name of the domain where you deployed it.
