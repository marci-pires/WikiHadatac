A basic HADatAc installation involves the following five steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console

* downloading HADatAc code from this GitHub repository 

* deploying HADatAc

## Step 1 : Acquiring Required Software

Before anything, however, we need to verify that the host machine has a `git client` to retrieve the code. In the command line of your machine, verify that you have a `git` client installed in your machine:

    git
 
If you do not have git, you need to install one: http://git-scm.com/downloads. 

Install a Docker Community Edition that can be downloaded from [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Docker is available for many operating systems as listed in the link above.

Go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to get started with Docker.

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc Code

The commands in this section are to be issued by root user

Create both /data and /data/git folders:

      mkdir -p /data/git

Go to git directory :

      cd /data/git

Once your are in your home directory (`~` is a shortcut for your home directory), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

     cd /data/git/hadatac

## Step 3: Deploying HADatAc

In HADatAc's home directory type the following:

     docker-compose build

Followed by the following command:

     docker-compose up -d 

Go to `http://(domain)/hadatac`, where `(domain)` is the name of your domain
