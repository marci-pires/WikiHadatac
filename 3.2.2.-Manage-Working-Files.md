Files that are under development are often stored in the working files part of HADatAc. The called Working Files is a place where files can be created, renamed, organized into folders, and edited within HADatAc. Also, the Working Files place can serve as a file repository since files can be quickly uploaded and downloaded.

The working file has a single folder hierarchy where users are allowed from any folder to create one or more subfolders. For instance, in the figure above, the user is in /CHEAR/DD folder and is allowed to go back in the hierarchy by selecting the two dots, or to create new folders using the "Create Folder" button above.
