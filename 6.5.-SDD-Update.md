The process of updating an SDD is straightforward.

## Step 1. Delete current version of the SDD to be updated

Go to "Home > Manage Data Dictionaries". Under "Existing Semantic Data Dictionaries" identify the SDD to be deleted. Under the "Operations" buttons corresponding to the identified SDD, select the "Delete" button. The "delete" button will ask to confirm (i.e., the red "Confirm Deletion" button) or to go back to Manage Data Dictionary without deleting the SDD. 

## Step 2. Upload new version of the SDD to be updated 

Submit the new SDD for ingestion at "HOME > Manage Data Files" (See Section ).
