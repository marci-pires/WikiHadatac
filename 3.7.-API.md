All API interfaces support authentication. If an API user does not supply credentials, they will only see the data and metadata visible to public users. If they are authenticated, they see only the data and metadata that is visible to that user, which can be a much smaller subset of the entire data and metadata collection.

## 3.7.1. Object Definitions

**Study**  
- uri - The unique URI that identifies this study and can be used in queries for measurement data (e.g. https://hadatac.org/kb/hbgd#STD-AMANHI)  
- label_short - A short label that identifies this study (e.g. AMANHI)  
- label_long - A longer label for the study (e.g. Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement)  
- location_uris - Array containing the URIs of all locations related to this study.  
- question_uris - Array containing the URIs of all questions related to this study.  
- variable_uris - Array containing the URIs of all variables that this study has some sort of measurement data for.  
- subject_uris - Array containing the URIs of all subjects that were in this study.  

**Variable**   
This is what we are calling anything for which measurement data is available. Things like height for age z-score (HAZ), etc.
- uri  
- label_short  
- label_long  
- unit_uri - URI for the unit that describes how this variable was measured.  

**Subject**
A subject in the study for which measurements of variables were made.  
- uri  
- id - The identifier used for this subject in the study.  

**Location** 
A place in the world where a study took place or even locations of individual subjects.  
- uri  
- label_short  
- label_long  

**Question**  
A question addressed by the study (e.g. How does body composition differ by sex, ethnicity, and region? From HBGDki data.)  
uri  
- label_long  
- label_short  

**Unit**  
The unit used for measuring a particular variable.  
- uri   
- label_short - String containing the units.  

## 3.7.2. API Calls

### 3.7.2.1. General Calls

GetStudies - Return all studies in HADatAc, with the properties specified here.
In Study’s POJO
List<Study> find()
GetStudiesURI

GetStudy - Return additional meta-information about a study given a study URI. Things like PI, Institution, etc.
In Study’s POJO
Study find(String study_uri)
Study findByName(String studyName)

GetVariables - Should return all variables
In DataAcquisitionSchemaAttribute’s POJO
List<DataAcquisitionSchema> findAll()
List<DataAcquisitionSchemaAttribute> findBySchema (String schemaUri)=
GetVariablesURI

GetVariable - Return additional meta-information about a variable given a variable URI.
In DataAcquisitionSchemaAttribute’s POJO
String getEntity()
String getAttribute()
String getUnit()
DataAcquisitionSchemaObject getObject()
String getEventUri()

GetObjectCollections - given a Study URI, return the URI’s of all ObjectCollections that are a part of that Study, and the Type of that collection (Subjects, Samples, etc).

GetObjects - given an ObjectCollection URI, return all StudyObjects in that collection

GetObject - Return information about a particular StudyObject in an ObjectCollection, given that StudyObject’s URI. This may be a “subject”, as in a subject of a study, but in hadatac’s system, this is only one possible type of StudyObject available. Others may include relatives of a study subject, or a specimen (e.g., blood or urine) taken as part of the study. Therefore “getObject” is the most general sense of this method.
In StudyObject’s POJO
StudyObject find(String obj_uri)

GetLocations - Return all locations where studies took place.
In Measurement’s POJO
String getLocation()
double getElevation()

GetLocation - Get detailed information about a location given a location URI.

GetUnits - Get all units used for all variables.
In Unit’s POJO
List<Unit> find()

GetUnit - Get information about a unit given a unit URI.
Getting Linked Nodes
For DJ search page, send a string and return an array of matching location uris, study uris, variable uris, subject uris, etc.

### 3.7.2.2. Fetching Measurement Data

The HADatAc SOLR database needs to be able to return measurements given a combination of the following URIs. At the moment, we do build and perform queries using these URIs, but there are some inconsistencies in the returned data (e.g. time stamps, values, variable uris).

study_uri
variable_uri
subject_uri

The measurements that are returned NEED to have a consistent timestamp format. Also, we need to be able to fetch only summary-level data or only subject-level data based on a parameter. We will also want to have parameters where we limit the measurement data between two timepoints, and a resolution parameter to limit how much data is returned. For example, if I specify no timepoints as limits, but a resolution value of 0.5, perhaps only half of all total timepoints available should be returned.

study_uri=[uri]&variable_uri=[uri2]&subject_uri=[uri3]
Return measurements of the given variable taken of the given subject for the given study. Do not return any summary-level data.

study_uri=[uri]&variable_uri=[uri2]
Return all measurements for all subjects of the given variable. Do not return any summary-level data.

study_uri=[uri]&variable_uri=[uri2]&summary
Return the summary data of the variable for the study. Do not return any subject-level data.
