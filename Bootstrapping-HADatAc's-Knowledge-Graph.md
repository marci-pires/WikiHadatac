## 2.2.1. HADatAc's Knowledge Graph

No data is expected to be properly ingested in HADatAc if its Knowledge Graph is not properly constructed.

The so-called Bootstrapping process, which is entirely described in this Section 2.2.1, should be used to construct the underlying knowledge graph every time the repositories are installed or erased. No bootstrapping should occur on HADatAc instance that has already been bootstrapped.
