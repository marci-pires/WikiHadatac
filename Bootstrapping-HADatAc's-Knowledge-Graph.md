## 2.2.1. HADatAc's Knowledge Graph

> **No data is expected to be properly ingested in HADatAc if its Knowledge Graph is not properly constructed**

HADatAc's Knowledge Graph is composed of the content inside both the data repository (SOLR) and the metadata repository (Blazegraph). The so-called __Bootstrapping process__, which is entirely described in this Section 2.2.1, entirely erases any data and metadata content inside of HADatAc (only information about users is preserved). No bootstrapping should occur on HADatAc instance that has already been bootstrapped.
