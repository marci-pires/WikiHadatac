## 2.2.1. HADatAc's Knowledge Graph

No data is expected to be properly ingested in HADatAc if its Knowledge Graph is not properly constructed.

HADatAc's Knowledge Graph is composed of the content inside both the data repository (SOLR) and the metadata repository (Blazegraph). The so-called __Bootstrapping process__, which is entirely described in this Section 2.2.1, should be used to construct the underlying knowledge graph __every time the repositories are installed or erased__. No bootstrapping should occur on HADatAc instance that has already been bootstrapped.
