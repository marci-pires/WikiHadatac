# 6.5 - SDD Update

The process of updating an SDD has the following three steps:

## Step 1. Delete current version of the SDD to be updated

Go to "Home &gt; Manage Semantic Data Dictionaries." Under "Existing Semantic Data Dictionaries" identify the SDD specification to be deleted from the knowledge graph. Under the "Operations" buttons corresponding to the identified SDD, select the "Delete" button. See notes in [Section 3.4.6.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.4.6.-Manage-Semantic-Data-Dictionaries#delete-sdd)

**Hint**: Before deleting the SDD, take note of its current version to compare with the version of the new SDD specification to be loaded.

## Step 2. Delete the actual SDD File from processed folders

Go to "Home &gt; Manage Data File Ingestion". In the processed folder, identify the SDD file to be ingested, and select the "Delete" operation \(for further details, see [Section 3.2.3.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#323-data-file-operations)\).

## Step 3. Upload new version of the SDD to be updated

Still inside "Manage Data File Ingestion," submit the new SDD for ingestion at "HOME &gt; Manage Data Files" \(See [Section 3.2.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-submission-of-data-file-for-ingestion)\).

**Hint**: Once the new version of the SDD has been ingested, go to "HOME &gt; Manage Semantic Data Dictionary" and view the SDD to verify that it was properly ingested. The version number should be different from the original SDD.
