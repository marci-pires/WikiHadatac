# 6.1.-Namespace-List-Update

The actual HADatAc namespace list resides inside a SOLR table, that:

* can be loaded from a file in HADatAc's configuration folder \(look for **\[HADatAC\_folder\]/conf** as described in [Section 2.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration)\), or 
* updated entirely through HADatAc's user interface under "HOME &gt; Manage Ontologies". 

Below we describe how to update the namespace list by **replacing and reloading a namespace list file** to HADatAc's configuration folder.

The actual structure of a namespace list is described in [Section 2.1.5](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties). In this Section, we will assume that one namespace list file is currently loaded, and that a new namespace list file needs to replace the current one. For example, let say that the file **namespace-v1.properties** is loaded and that it needs to be replaced by the file **namespace-v2.properties**.

These are the four steps of the update:

## Step 1. Erase the current namespace list from SOLR

Go to "HOME &gt; Manage Ontologies". Delete the list by selecting the "Delete All Rows" button -- this is the only red button on the page below the namespace list \(depending on the size of the current list, you may need to scroll down to find the button\).

After pressing the button, the entire namespace list under "Namespace Management" should be empty.

## Step 2. Add the name namespace list file to the HADatAc configuration folder

On the machine terminal hosting HADatAc, go to **\[HADatAc\_folder\]/conf** and add the updated version of your namespace list file.

Although it is not required, it may be good to rename or remove the old version of the namespace list file not to confuse it with the updated version. One way of making sure that files are properly updated in the configuration file is to include a version number into the filename.

## Step 3. Load the namespace list file into SOLR

Back to the HADatAc app on the browser, go to "HOME &gt; Manage Ontologies". Use the "Browse" button below "Namespace Management" to select the updated namespace list file. Once the file has been selected, press the green "Parse and Load" button below the file to upload its content into SOLR.

The table below "Namespace Management" is the actual list in SOLR. Thus, a new namespace list should appear as a result of loading the updated namespace list file.

## Step 4. From the new list already loaded into SOLR, reload the contents of the namespaces from the web.

Repeat the procedure for loading ontologies described in [Step 4 of Section 2.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap#step-4-upload-ontologies)
