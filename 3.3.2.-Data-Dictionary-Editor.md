This is the Working Files' editor for Data Dictionaries (DDs). 

## Data Dictionary Editor

The DD Editor can be used for editing DDs. Different than other semantic documents that have a more rigid template to be followed, DDs can be documents in any way their authors want, we everything that is documents being contained in one sheet, or multiple sheets, and with different notes being used. From a semantic point of view, the main purpose of the DD editor is to help help the SDD editing by identifying the following: 

* the sheet/column that has the list of labels of the file
* the sheet/column that has the description of the content within each label

### Column Selection

On the “Data Dictionary” sheet, right click and select appropriately “Header” or “Description” based on the proper column.
See the sheet name and the column name appear in the proper text boxes located at the top of the page.
