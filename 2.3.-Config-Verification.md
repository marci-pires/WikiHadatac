Six values are used to verify if a current HADatAc installation is up-to-date:

* Short name of the current HADatAC installation
* Code's version
* Name of the latest namespaces.properties file loaded, if any
* Base ontology's prefix
* Base ontology's namespace
* Version of the loaded base ontology, if any

These six values are accurately gathered and show using the version link available at the bottom of the HADatAc's homepage. The figure below shows where the link is located on the homepage.

And the figure below shows the output of selecting the link, which includes the six values for a given HADatAc installation.
