# 1.7.-Upgrading

## 1.7.1. General Instructions for Upgrading HADatAc code

As described in [Section 2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration), if HADatAc is installed on "**\[HADatAc\_home\]**", the actual configuration folder for the installation is in "**\[HADatAc\_home\]/conf**". The content of **\[HADatAc\_home\]/conf** folder in github is an example that **is assumed** to not be fit for any real installation. In other words, we do not work with the assumption that one can download and run HADatAc without going through the configuration procedure. Since nobody wants to lose their configuration once it is working, **making a personal copy of your configuration folder** is strongly recommended before any software upgrade.

It is further recommended for personal copies of the configuration folder to be located outside of "\[HADatAc_home\]." Without making a personal copy, the configuration can be lost because an update of the git repository from github, i.e., `git pull`, should override **\[HADatAc\_home\]/conf**. For instance, "**\[HADatAc\]/../conf**" is an example of a folder outside of "\_\[HADatAc\]_" that is not modified during `git pull`, and that can be used to store local configuration files.

## 1.7.2. Upgrading Development Installation

In development environments, the software developer is responsible for copying and restoring the HADatAc configuration folder for its local installations.

### Step 1 \(Development\): Stop HADatAc

By issuing a CTLR-C inside of the terminal running sbt, one can stop HADatAc in development

### Step 2 \(Development\): Backup your configuration folder

Copy **\[HADatAc\_home\]/conf** to a folder ouside of **\[HADatAc\_home\]**, that we are going to call **\[conf\_backup\]**.

### Step 3 \(Development\): Upgrade HADatAc code in local git

Go to **\[HADatAc\_home\]**. In the command below, replace \[HADatAc\_home\] with the actual path of the home folder:

```text
cd [HADatAc_home]
```

Issue the following command from **\[HADatAc\_home\]**:

```text
 git pull
```

This command will update the content of your local git repository

### Step 3 \(Development\): Restore your configuration folder

Copy content from **\[conf\_backup\]** folder to **\[HADatAc\_home\]**.

### Step 4 \(Development\): Restart sbt

From \[HADatAc\_home\], execute the following command:

```text
sbt run
```

## 1.7.3. Upgrading Production Installation

Be aware about the note in [Section 1.7.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/1.7.-Upgrading#171-general-instructions-for-upgrading-hadatac-code) Please also be aware that the upgrading script for production used below will take care of backing up existing configuration folder before `git pull`, and will take care of restoring the folder after the `git pull`.

### Step 1 \(Production\): Stop SOLR, Blazegraph and HADatAc

Go to **\[solr\_home\]/solr** folder and stop solr

```text
cd [solr_home]/solr
./run_solr6.sh stop
```

Stop the web container \(jetty8,jetty9,tomcat8, or tomcat9\) used to host blazegraph

```text
service jetty9 stop
```

Stop HADatAc

```text
service hadatac stop
```

### Step 2 \(Production\): Execute Upgrading Script

Go to \[HADatAc\_home\]

```text
cd [HADatAc_home]
```

Execute the following command:

```text
./deploy_hadatac.sh
```

Wait for the script to execute, generate a new distribution file, and deploy the distribution file.

### Step 3 \(Production\): Restart SOLR, Blazegraph and HADatAc

Go to solr folder and start solr

```text
cd [solr_home]/solr
./run_solr6.sh start
```

Start the web container \(jetty8,jetty9,tomcat8 or tomcat9\) used to host blazegraph

```text
service jetty8 start
```

Start HADatAc

```text
service hadatac start
```
