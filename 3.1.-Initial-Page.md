At the very top of the page there is a black bar that is always visible within HADatAc. On the left of the bar, there is a "HADatAc Home" label that can be clicked to bring you back to the home page. On the far right of the bar, there is either a login button (if you have not logged it) or a button with the user currently logged into the app.

The main page is composed of two or three vertical blocks of functionalities. The image below shows the page with the three blocks when the user currently logged into the system has admin permission. The third block on the right is not visible when the user currently logged does not have admin permission. The third block also does not show, and most options in the first two blocks are disabled, when no user is logged.

The first block has the functionalities required for a user to search and retrieve content from HADatAc. 

The second block has the functionalities required to update and maintain content in HADatAc. 

The third block has the functionalities required for managing underlying knowledge. Most of the functionalities in this block are used to maintain the data and metadata repositories, and to bootstrap the knowledge graph. These functionalities are described in [Section 2.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap) The __Manage User__ functionality in this block is used to support the functionalities described in [Section 5.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.1.-Access-Network) and [5.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.2.-User-Status,-Categories-and-Access-Permissions)
