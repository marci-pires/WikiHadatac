## Page Organization

At the very top of the page there is a black bar. In the middle of the page there two or three columns of functionalities. The number of columns depending on whether the logged used has administrator permission or not. The top bar is always visible. The column on the left is the Data/Metadata Search and Retrieval block. The second column is the Data/Metadata Acquisition block. The third column is the Knowledge Management block. The image below shows the page with the three columns when the user currently logged into the system has admin permission.

## 3.1.1. HADatAc HOME

On the left of the bar, there is a "HADatAc Home" label that can be clicked to bring you back to the home page. On the far right of the bar, there is either a login button (if you have not logged it) or a button with the user currently logged into the app.

## 3.1.2. Sandbox Mode

At the end of the list of main options, there is a "Sandbox Mode" button that allows the selection of current operational environment. It is important to note that one HADatAc installation has two distinct operational environments, each one with its own knowledge graph:

* __main environment__ (a.k.a. out of sandbox) is the default environment if the "Sandbox Mode" has never been selected. If the "Sandbox Mode" at the top bar of HADatAc is not in yellow then main is the current environment
* __sandbox environment__ (a.k.a. in sandbox) is the testing environment. The "Sandbox Mode" button needs to be selected, and once inside a dialog panel, it needs to be confirmed the request to enter sandbox mode. Once the sandbox mode has been selected, the button in the top bar of HADatAc is going to be in yellow.

A main purpose of the sandbox environment is to test the ingestion of new studies, ontologies, without affecting stable ontologies. In this case, stable ontologies are kept out of the sandbox while unstable ontologies are adjusted until become stable, when they can be ingested out of sandbox. Using this approach, we suggest a complete knowledge graph bootstrap of sandbox (see Section ) every time a new study is ingested, and an incremental evolution of the main knowledge graph using the features described in Section . 

## 3.1.3. Data/Metadata Search and Retrieval

The first block has the functionalities to search and retrieve HADatAc content.

## 3.1.4. Data/Metadata Acquisition

The second block has the functionalities required to add and maintain HADatAc content.

## 3.1.5. Knowledge Management

The third block has the functionalities required for managing underlying knowledge. Most of the functionalities in this block are used to maintain the data and metadata repositories, and to bootstrap the knowledge graph. These functionalities are described in [Section 2.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap)

The __Manage User__ functionality in this block is used to support the functionalities described in [Section 7.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/7.1.-Access-Network) and [7.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/7.2.-User-Status,-Categories-and-Access-Permissions)
