> **No data is expected to be properly ingested in HADatAc if its Knowledge Graph is not bootstrapped**

## 2.2.1. HADAtAc Knowledge Graph (KG)

HADatAc's Knowledge Graph is composed of the content inside both the data repository (SOLR) and the metadata repository (Blazegraph). 

## 2.2.2. Bootstrap without Labkey

The __Bootstrapping process__, which is entirely described in this Section 2.2., erases any data and metadata content inside of HADatAc (only preserving information about user accounts). No bootstrapping should occur on HADatAc instance that has already been bootstrapped. __Bootstrapping process__ consists of three steps if not using LabKey or five steps if using LabKey:

Step 1. Erase existing files uploaded into HADatAc, if any  
Step 2. Erase any previous data/metadata  
Step 3. Upload ontologies  

## (Step 1) Erase Any Existing File on HADatAc 

**Action**: Go to "HADatAc Home > Manage Data Files". Select and Delete button next to each file in both processed folder and unprocessed folder  

**Verification**:  Still in "HADatAc Home > Manage Data Files". Confirm that no file is listed under processed folder and unprocessed folder

## (Step 2) Erase Data and Metadata Repositories 
 
Clearing the data before beginning the ingestion process of datasets is one way to ensure the exact control over the contents of HADatAc's repositories. 

**Action**: Clean repositories. Go to "HADatAc Home > Repository Management". Select the following buttons, one button a time: "Clean Data", "Clean Data Acquisitions" and "Clean Metadata"

**Verification**:  After cleaning the Data Repository and Metadata Repository, they should be like this:

Note: The "user graph content" should have some triples corresponding to knowledge about user accounts within HADatAc. There is no option in HADatAc itself to erase the user graph because erasing user-related triples would prevent one of staying logged or logging into HADatAc.

## (Step 3) Upload Ontologies

HADatAc ontologies provide the concepts required for the framework to acquire and manage scientific data. Those ontologies may be loaded straight from the web, or may be cached locally in case they need to be reloaded afterward, when connectivity may be unavailable. 
  
**Action**:  Go to "HADatAc Home > Manage Ontologies > Load Ontologies from the Web" (See figure below). By loading ontologies from the web you are also caching them locally. In case you already have cached ontologies, you can also used the "Load cached ontologies" to upload the content of these ontologies into the metadata repository.

**Verification**: verify message about loading ontologies. Each ontology in the namespace list should result in some triples being added into the metadata repository (i.e., the triplestore). After loading the ontologies the number of triples should increase to +15,000. The exact numbers of triples may vary as the content of these ontologies, which are maintained by thrid-party entities, may vary over time.

**Alternative Verification**:  Go to blazegraph service (see the exact address in HADatAc's configuration file), and then to the query menu. Once there, type the following SPARQL query: 

	select ?p ?o ?u where {?p ?o ?u . } 	

In the case of this example, you should get +15,000 triples as result. 

## 2.2.3. Boostrap with Labkey

Two additional steps are required to boostrap HADatAc's Knowledge Graph when Labkey is used to store the base ontology:

Step 4. Upload base ontology [if using LabKey] 
Step 5. Upload knowledge graph [if using LabKey]

## (Step 4) Upload Base Ontology (only if your Base Ontology is in LabKey)

**Action**: Go through the following steps: 
* Go to "HADatAc Home > Load Ontology from Labkey"
* If you are logging into LabKey for the first time during the current session, HADatAc will ask for your username and password in Labkey
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac-screenshots/master/Sec2/labkey-connect.png)
* Once you provide your credentials, you need to select the "view" button of the specific LabKey folder that you are going to upload you data from 
* Press the "Batch Loading Concepts" button **at the bottom of the page** 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac-screenshots/master/Sec2/load-ont.png)

Note that you have two options to upload the main ontology: (a) to use labkey to feed your main ontology ("Load Ontology from LabKey"), or (b) to upload an ontology itself by using the "Upload Additional Knowledge".

A brief note about LabKey: LabKey contains a copy of Hadatac's Knowledge Graph state encoded as a collection of tables. Each table is either a concept table or an instance list. The first column of each table is always hasUri. The second column is either a rdfs:subClassOf or a rdf:type (represented in RDF also by an 'a'). If the second column is the rdfs:subClassOf predicate, then the table is for concepts, otherwise it is for instances. The complete set of concept tables represents the "ontology" that is loaded from Labkey. The set of instance tables are all instances of HADatAc. KG is the set of ontology + instances + values from the data repository.

**Verification**: verify the message generated after selecting "Batch Loading Concepts". It should have say the the concepts were loaded successfully. If the loading fail, it will show the line of the exact TTL file that was generated from LabKey and indicate the number of the line in the TTL file that prevented content to be added into HADatAc. In that case, you need to locate and fix the content of your LabKey repository that corresponds to the error message.

## (Step 5) Upload Knowledge Base (only if your knowledge graph is in LabKey)

Action: Now you need to "Load Knowledge from Labkey". Hadatac will ask for your username and password in labkey. Then you click on "view" on your specific labkey folder.  Click on "Select All" checkbox. 

Click on "Batch Loading Selected Instance Data" button. 

Msg: Operation [load] complete -- check the results above to see if the parsing of the facts was successful.
