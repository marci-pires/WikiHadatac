## Data/Metadata File Ingestion

_Data/Metadata ingestion_ is the combined process of processing of (Step 1) uploading data/metadata files into the infrastructure's filesystem, and of (Step 2) moving files in the filesystem into the infrastructure's databases.  

Any kind of file can be submitted for ingestion into HADatAc, but only files that meet the following criteria are ingested into HADatAc: 

* files that are associated with existing data streams; and 
* files that are in CSV or Excel formats a (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). 

## Manual Data File Ingest

Manual data file upload is done by going to __Home > Manage Data Files__.

The screenshot above shows the __Manage Data Files__ user interface, showing three distinct areas. 

* drop file area
* processed files folder
* unprocessed files folder

Data files are manually submitted for ingestion by dragging and dropping files into the grey drop file area. Once files are uploaded, they will show up in the unprocessed files folder. For instance, the __DA-CBIS-Feb-2017-DMG-B-3.csv__ in the image above was uploaded into HADatAc, and it is now assigned to a user who can leave the datafile there or may decide to share, download or even delete the file. Once files are uploaded, they are matched against existing streams. 

* If files are __matched against existing streams__, the ingestion of the file starts automatically. 

* If files are __not matched against existing stream__, the association of the file to a stream needs to be done manually, and it may require the creation of a new stream for the file. The manual process of assigning a file to a data stream is described in [Section 3.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.1.-Data-File-Preparation). 

## Automatic Data File Ingest

The process of submitting files for HADatAc ingestion can be accomplished programatically. In this case, the code or script responsible for uploading new data files into HADatAc needs to have permission to write files into the __unprocessed csv__ folder of HADatAc.

The exact location of (unprocessed and processed) files uploaded in HADatAc is defined in the autoccsv.config file (as described in [Section 2.1.4](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#214-setting-up-autoccsvconfig)).
