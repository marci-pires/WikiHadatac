## Data/Metadata File Ingestion

_Data/Metadata ingestion_ is the combined process of processing of (Step 1) uploading data/metadata files into the infrastructure's filesystem, and of (Step 2) moving files in the filesystem into the infrastructure's databases.  

Any kind of file can be submitted for ingestion into HADatAc, but only files that meet the following criteria are ingested into HADatAc: 

* files that are associated with existing data streams; and 
* files that are in CSV or Excel formats a (we are planing to support more data formats in the future). 

## Automatic Data File Ingest

The process of submitting files for HADatAc ingestion can be accomplished programatically. In this case, the code or script responsible for uploading new data files into HADatAc needs to have permission to write files into the __unprocessed csv__ folder of HADatAc.

The exact location of (unprocessed and processed) files uploaded in HADatAc is defined in the autoccsv.config file (as described in [Section 2.1.4](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#214-setting-up-autoccsvconfig)). 

## Manual Data File Ingest

Data Files can be manually or automatically associated with streams. The manual process of assigning a file to a data stream in described in [Section 3.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.1.-Data-File-Preparation).
