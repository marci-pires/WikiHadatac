The actual HADatAc namespace list resides inside in a SOLR table, that can be loaded from a file in HADatAc's configuration folder (See Section to review where is your configuration file), or updated entirely through HADatAc's user interface under "HOME > Manage Ontologies". Below we describe how to update the namespace list by __replacing and reloading a namespace list file__ to HADatAc's configuration folder.

The actual structure of a namespace list is described in Section . In this Section, we will assume that one namespace list file is currently loaded, and that a new namespace list file needs to replace the current one. For example, let say that the file __namespace-v1.properties__ is loaded and that it needs to be replaced by the file __namespace-v2.properties__. 

These are the update steps:

1. Erase the current namespace list from SOLR

2. Load the namespace list from the file into SOLR

3. From the new list already loaded into SOLR, reload the contents of the namespaces from the web
