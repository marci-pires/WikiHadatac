The actual HADatAc namespace list resides inside in a SOLR table, that 

* can be loaded from a file in HADatAc's configuration folder (look for __[HADatAC_folder]/conf__ as described in [Section 2.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration)), or 
* updated entirely through HADatAc's user interface under "HOME > Manage Ontologies". 

Below we describe how to update the namespace list by **replacing and reloading a namespace list file** to HADatAc's configuration folder.

The actual structure of a namespace list is described in [Section 2.1.5](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties). In this Section, we will assume that one namespace list file is currently loaded, and that a new namespace list file needs to replace the current one. For example, let say that the file __namespace-v1.properties__ is loaded and that it needs to be replaced by the file __namespace-v2.properties__. 

These are the four steps of the update:

### Step 1. Erase the current namespace list from SOLR

Go to "HOME > Manage Ontologies". Delete the list by selecting the "Delete All Rows" button -- this is the only red button on the page below the namespace list (depending on the size of the current list, you may need to scroll down to find the button).  

After pressing the button, the entire namespace list under "Namespace Management" should be empty.

### Step 2. Add the name namespace list file to HADatAc configuration folder 

An updated version of the namespace list file should be added to [HADatAc_folder]/conf).
One way of making sure that files are properly updated in the configuration file is to include a version number to the name of the file, to make sure that the new version of the file is in the folder. 

### Step 3. Load the namespace list from the file into SOLR

Go to "HOME > Manage Ontologies". Use the "Browse" button below "Namespace Management" to select the new version of the namespace list file. Once the file has been selected, press the green "Parse and Load" button below the file to update the list in SOLR. 

The table below "Namespace Management" is the actual list in SOLR. Thus, a new namespace list should appear as a result of loading a new namespace list file.

### Step 4. From the new list already loaded into SOLR, reload the contents of the namespaces from the web

Repeat the procedure for loading ontologies described in [Step 3 of Section 2.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap#step-3-upload-supporting-ontologies)
