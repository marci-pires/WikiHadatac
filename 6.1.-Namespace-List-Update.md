The actual HADatAc namespace list resides inside in a SOLR table, that 

* can be loaded from a file in HADatAc's configuration folder (look for __[HADatAC_folder]/conf__ as described in [Section 2.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration)), or 
* updated entirely through HADatAc's user interface under "HOME > Manage Ontologies". 

Below we describe how to update the namespace list by **replacing and reloading a namespace list file** to HADatAc's configuration folder.

The actual structure of a namespace list is described in [Section 2.1.5](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties). In this Section, we will assume that one namespace list file is currently loaded, and that a new namespace list file needs to replace the current one. For example, let say that the file __namespace-v1.properties__ is loaded and that it needs to be replaced by the file __namespace-v2.properties__. 

These are the three steps of the update:

### Step 1. Erase the current namespace list from SOLR

### Step 2. Load the namespace list from the file into SOLR

### Step 3. From the new list already loaded into SOLR, reload the contents of the namespaces from the web
