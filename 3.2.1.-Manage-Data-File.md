Manual data file upload is done by going to __Home > Manage Data Files__.

The screenshot above shows the __Manage Data Files__ user interface, showing three distinct areas. 

* drop file area
* processed files folder
* unprocessed files folder

Data files are manually uploaded into HADatAc by dragging and dropping files into the grey drop file area. Once files are uploaded, they will show up in the unprocessed files folder. For instance, the __DA-CBIS-Feb-2017-DMG-B-3.csv__ in the image above was uploaded into HADatAc, and it is now assigned to a user who can leave the datafile there or may decide to share, download or even delete the file. Once files are uploaded, they can either be automatically ingested in case they are associated to a data acquisition as explained above.
