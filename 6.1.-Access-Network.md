## 6.1.1. Access Network Elements

Every HADatAc has one access network composed of 
* access levels and 
* users

HADatAcâ€™s access networks are initially composed of one default access level called __public__. Every user belongs to one access level, and is an access level on its own. For instance, if the access network is brand new, it only has the access level _public_. Therefore, if a new user _Carol_ is added, it is added under _public_. The figure above shows a more complete example of an access network where we see the node representing __Carol__ pointing to the __pulic__ node. This means that any data added by __Carol__ to HADatAc will initially belong to __Carol__ who will be the only user capable of accessing that data. If __Carol__ needs to share the data, __Carol__ can relax the restriction on the data by moving the access to the data to __public__. 

On the same way that users are added to an access network, new access level can also be added. __Public__ is the less restricted level of access in the access network and the further an access level with respect to _public_ the more restricted it the access level. In the figure above we see that three access levels have been added to our example network: __Project__, __Group A__, and __Group B__. We also see that both __Group A__ and __Group B__ are connected to __Project__, meaning that __Project__ is the less restricted of these access nodes.

In terms of building an access network, we need to observe the following:  
- Every access level must be connected to another access level (and that __public__ is a default access level available in any access network. This rule also implies that an access level cannot be connected to a user.
- Every user needs must be connected to an access level    

## 6.1.2. Access Vectors

Every user has an access vector. For instance, in the figure above, __Helen__ has the following access vector: <__Helen__,__Group A__, __Project__, __public__>. That means that any data owned by __Helen__ is assigned to be accessed only by __Helen__ (unless this rule is overwritten by the permission credentials in an OAS file being used to load __Helen__'s data). From there, __Helen__ can go to the data acquisition specification of her data and grant access to any of the levels in her access vector, including __public__.
