A basic HADataC installation involves the following four steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console

* downloading the HADatAC Console code from this GitHub repository, and 

* executing its installation script. 

The instructions below describe how to obtain and install these components, and test if the installation is working properly.

## Step 1 : Acquiring Required Software

Before anything, however, we need to verify that the host machine has a `git client` to retrieve the code, and an `sbt` utility to run the console. In the command line of your machine, verify that you have a `git` client installed in your machine:

    git
 
If you do not have git, you need to install one: http://git-scm.com/downloads. Still from the command line, verify that you have `sbt` applications installed in your machine:

    sbt

If not, you need to install one: http://www.scala-sbt.org/.

You will also need:

1. Java JDK 8: http://java.com/en/download/ (or use your distribution's java)

    sudo apt-get install default-jdk

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

2. wget

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc-Console

On the terminal, go to your home directory by typing the following (`cd` is change directory) :

      cd ~

Once your are in your home directory (`~` is a shortcut for your home directory), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

     cd ~/hadatac


If youâ€™re lost type: 

     pwd 

to find out where you are. 
If you want to list all the files and folders around you type: 

     ls 

If you want to get back to the start just type: 

     cd

## Step 3: Installing HADatAc

Once you are in the hadatac folder (you can check if you are in the right folder by typing `pwd`), type the following:

      ./install_hadatac.sh

This process will take a while so let it run. It will copy the files, download and install the two SOLR instances required by HADatAc, and initialize the instances.

During the process of executing the script, you will be asked for an installation folder. If possible, just accept the installation folder suggested by the script. If not, specify a different installation directory. Keep note of what is your installation file since you will need to use it in the next step. The script downloads JETTY and put it into hadatac-blazegraph directory by default. We start JETTY to run BLAZEGRAPH at localhost:8080/blazegraph. Before starting JETTY, we need to set the path of the journal file of BLAZEGRAPH for storing triples. To do this, open the RWStore.properties file under ~/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/webapps/blazegraph/WEB-INF/classes and the configuration as follows

     com.bigdata.journal.AbstractJournal.file={BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/blazegraph.jnl

Replace the BASE_DIR with path according to your local environment. Please use absolute path for this setting. To start JETTY, run

     sh {BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/bin/jetty.sh start

Open your browser to verify if the SOLR installations were successful
* Open another tab with the url: [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/)

And verify if the BLAZEGRAPH installations were successful,
* Open another tab with the url: [http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/](http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/)

To create required namespaces for hadatac triplestore, run 

     sh ./create_namespaces.sh

If you want to stop JETTY to stop BLAZEGRAPH, run

     sh {BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/bin/jetty.sh stop


## Step 5: Running HADatAc

Go back to terminal, and go to your installation folder by typing the following, after making sure that you replace the `(your hadatac installation directory)` by your actual hatadac installation directory:

     cd (your hadatac installation directory)

Now type the following: 

     sbt

Note:Navigate to the hadatac folder using cd in the terminal window, before typing sbt
This step will take a long time the first time.

In the terminal window you should see `[hadatac]`
In the terminal window type: 

     run

Wait for confirmation message that the project is running.

Browser open hadatac
url: [http://localhost:9000/hadatac/](http://localhost:9000/hadatac/)

Wait for page to open, it will take a while.
