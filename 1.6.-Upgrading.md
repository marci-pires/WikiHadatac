## 1.6.1. General Instructions for Upgrading HADatAc code

As described in [Section 2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration), if HADatAc is installed on "__[HADatAc_home]__", the actual configuration folder for the installation is in "__[HADatAc_home]/conf__". The content of __[HADatAc_home]/conf__ folder in github is an example that __is assumed__ to not be fit for any real installation. In other words, we do not work with the assumption that one can download and run HADatAc without going through the configuration procedure. Since nobody wants to lose their configuration once it is working, __making a personal copy of your configuration folder__ is strongly recommended before any software upgrade. 

It is further recommended for personal copies of the configuration folder to be located outside of "[HADatAc_home]." Without making a personal copy, the configuration can be lost because an update of the git repository from github, i.e., `git pull`, should override __[HADatAc_home]/conf__. For instance, "__[HADatAc]/../conf__" is an example of a folder outside of "__[HADatAc]__" that is not modified during `git pull`, and that can be used to store local configuration files.

## 1.6.2. Upgrading Development Installation

In development environments, the software developer is responsible for copying and restoring the HADatAc configuration folder for its local installations. 

### Step 1 (Development): Stop HADatAc 

By issuing a CTLR-C inside of the terminal running sbt, one can stop HADatAc in development

### Step 2 (Development): Backup your configuration folder

Copy __[HADatAc_home]/conf__ to a folder ouside of __[HADatAc_home]__, that we are going to call __[conf_backup]__. 

### Step 3 (Development): Upgrade HADatAc code in local git

Go to __[HADatAc_home]__. In the command below, replace [HADatAc_home] with the actual path of the home folder:

    cd [HADatAc_home]

Issue the following command from __[HADatAc_home]__:

     git pull

This command will update the content of your local git repository
 
### Step 3 (Development): Restore your configuration folder

Copy content from __[conf_backup]__ folder to __[HADatAc_home]__. 

### Step 4 (Development): Restart sbt

From [HADatAc_home], execute the following command:

    sbt run

## 1.6.3. Upgrading Production Installation

Be aware about the note in [Section 1.6.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/1.6.-Upgrading#161-general-instructions-for-upgrading-hadatac-code) Please also be aware the the upgrading script will also take care of backing up you configuration folder, as well as form restoring it after a git pull
 
### Step 1 (Production): Stop SOLR, Blazegraph and HADatAc

Go to __[solr_home]/solr__ folder and stop solr

    cd [solr_home]/solr
    ./run_solr6.sh stop

Stop the web container (jetty8,jetty9,tomcat8, or tomcat9) used to host blazegraph

    service jetty9 stop

Stop HADatAc 

    service hadatac stop

### Step 2 (Production): Execute Upgrading Script

Go to [HADatAc_home]

    cd [HADatAc_home]

Execute the following command:
    
    ./deploy_hadatac.sh

Wait for the script to execute, generate a new distribution file, and deploy the distribution file.

### Step 3 (Production): Restart SOLR, Blazegraph and HADatAc

Go to solr folder and start solr

    cd [solr_home]/solr
    ./run_solr6.sh start

Start the web container (jetty8,jetty9,tomcat8 or tomcat9) used to host blazegraph

    service jetty8 start

Start HADatAc 

    service hadatac start
