## 5.3.1. When to use a Semantic Study Design (SSD)

Semantic Study Designs are required when the structure of the study affects the understanding and quality of the data acquired from the study. The structure of a study is mainly composed of objects related to the study and relations between these objects. Objects like subjects, samples, locations and events identified during the design of a study are strong candidates to go inside of an SSD file. Objects like subjects and samples are called domain objects and may have relevant relationships between them, for example, when samples are from the subjects. Objects like events may be used to identify when subjects are under observation or when samples are collected. Objects like locations may be used to identify when and where subjects are under observation. Locations may also be the objects that are sample, for instance, when locations are from an open environment of an indoor ambience. 

## 5.3.2. How to Build an SSD
Inspecting written descriptions of a study is an effective main way of acquiring knowledge relevant to write effective SSDs. Interviewing with study's designers, e.g., Principal Investigator(s), is another valuable way of learning how a study is structured. By inspecting available documentation and knowledge about a given study, one may be able to write an SSD. We observe that it may be challenging for one to write an SSD for new categories of studies that have not been semantically described before. Our suggestion is to not see the writing of SSDs as a one-time event that needs to produce a complete SSD, but instead, an incremental process where SSD descriptions are refined into a specification that meets the requirement for annotating data. Nevertheless, we propose the following four-step process described below to facilitate the construction of a study's SSD:

### Step 1: Identify Semantic Object Collections (SOC)  

Objects with explicitly assigned identifiers are strong candidates to be grouped into Semantic Object Collections (SOCs). For example, when __Participant IDs (PIDs)__ are assigned to subjects, we expect one SOC to be created for subjects. Further, if samples are collected from these subjects, and each sample is assigned with a __Sample ID (SID)__, these samples are also expected to become a new SOC.

In the table below we show the __SSD sheet__ of an SSD for __Study A__. This new __Study A__ is stated as the study of concern of this SDD by declaring it in the first row below the header. The URI of the study should be exactly the same URI given to the study in its STD file. (Please scroll to the right to see the entire content of this __SDD sheet__ example.

sheet |	hasURI	| type	| hasSOCReference | comment | label | definition | groundingLabel | isMemberOf | hasScope | hasTimeScope | hasSpaceScope | cardinality | role | basetime | source
----- | ------- | ----- | --------------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ---- | --------- | ---------------  
| | kb:STD-A | hasco:Study | | | | | | | |  
#SOC-SUBJECTS | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS	| hasco:SubjectGroup | ??child | child, the main subject of the study | Child | persons | Child | kb:STD-A | | | | 6 | ont:isSubjectOf   
#SOC-SAMPLES | kb:SOC-SAMPLES | hasco:SampleCollection | ??sample |  samples of urine collected from children | Urine Sample | urine sample |  | kb:STD-A | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS | | | 1 | ont:isSampleOf |   

The two rows below the study row (i.e., the second and third row below the file header) are the rows defining the two SOCs of Study A: __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__ and __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The first column of the __SSD sheet__ identifies other SSD sheets where _object specific_ information can be found for each semantic object collection. The content of these other sheets are described in Steps 3 and 4 of this session. 

The other SOC properties are the following: 

__type__: A SOC needs to be one of the following four types: {__hasco:SubjectGroup__, __hasco:SampleCollection__, __hasco:TimeCollection__, __hasco:SpaceCollection__}.

__hasSOCReference__: This is an identifier that must start with "??" and be followed with short identifier that is unique within the study. This property is a mechanism used by Semantic Data Dictionaries (SDDs) to refer to SOCs and their objects (SDDs are described in [Section 5.4.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.4.-Semantic-Data-Dictionary-(SDD)).
 
__comment__: It is a "free form" properties of a SOC declaration used for further documenting the SOC. This property is used to store additional details about the SOC that may not be documented elsewhere, and that is regarded relevant to be preserved. 

__label__: It is a very important property when no __groundingLabel__ is assigned to the SOC since it is used to derive the final "role label" assigned to every object of the SOC. For instance, since no grounding label is assigned to the Sample's SOC above, every object of the SOC with have a label prefixed with "Child Urine Sample" where "Child" is from the grounding label of the SUbject's SOC, and "Urine Sample" is the label of the SOC as stated here. 

__definition__: It is a free-form formal description of the SOC.

__groundingLabel__: Certain categories of objects are well defined by a given term, while others depend of their relationship to other objects. For instance, in some studies, the terms "Child" and "Mother" may be complete and precise enough for scientists involved with these studies to fully identify the nature of these objects of concern. These terms are called __Grounding Labels__ for their corresponding SOCs. Within the same studies, the term "Sample" may not be complete enough to identify the nature of sample objects: for example, these objects may be samples from a child, or samples from a mother, and it is important to say something like "Mother's Sample" than just "Sample". In this case, the SOCs of Children and Mothers are grounded by the terms "Child" and "Mother", while the SOC Sample may not have any grounding label. In this case, it is important for non-grounded objects to be logically connected to one grounded object.

__isMemberOf__: The URI of the study also declared in the first row of the SSD. This property states that the SOC being created belongs the the study which URI is stated here.

### Step 2: Identify Relationships Among SOCs
 
Relationships between SOCs can vary greatly from one study to another, that is one of the main reasons why a study may need to use an SSD file instead of using simpler PID and MAP files to describe its objects. When building a SSD, we need to identify relationships between SOCs identified in Step 1. 

In the SSD in Step 1, we observe that the __hasScope__ of samples is subjects collection (i.e., __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__). We further see that the subject's cardinality is 6 and that the sample's cardinality is 1. Since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC, the exact number of subjects is its cardinality of 6. Since samples are in the scope of subjects, the cardinality means that the SOC expects to have one sample for each subject (1 x 6) for a total of six samples.

The role's column specifies the role of study objects. The SSD specifies __ont:isSubjectOf__ meaning that each object is a __ont:isSubjectOf__ the object representing the study since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC. For samples, however, we observe that each sample is __ont:isSampleOf__ of a subject object. These mappings are further specified in the object-level sheets of the SSD.

### Step 3: Identify Study Objects for each SOC 

The identification of objects is very simple and consists of a list with two columns as many rows as are the number of objects inside the SOC. For example, the table below shows the __#SOC-SUBJECTS__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__'s SOC. 

originalID | rdf:type 
---------- | -------- 
10001 | sio:Human
10002 | sio:Human
10003 | sio:Human
10004 | sio:Human
10005 | sio:Human
10006 | sio:Human

__originalID__: The first column of the sheet is the identifier used to name each object in the SOC. The identifier can be any string as long as there is no two objects with a common identifier in the SOC. Six objects named "10001", "10002", "10003", "10004", "10005" and "10006" are defines in the example above. 

__rdf:type__: The second column of the sheet contains the type of each object in the SOC. In general, the types of objects inside of a SOC are of a single category, although this is not a requirement (for example, in the sample's SOC, some of the samples could be of urine although others can be or "blood". In the example above, each one of the six objects in the Subject's SOC is of type "Human" as defined in the [SIO ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SIO).  

### Step 4: Mapping Study Objects from Related SOCs  

The table below shows the __#SOC-SAMPLES__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The sheet contains a list of the study-specific identifier and type of each object, plus a relationship to other objects through the value in the  __hasScopeID__ column. In our example, this extra column is needed to map each sample to each subject. 

originalID | rdf:type | hasScopeID
---------- | -------- | ----------
U000001	| sio:Urine | 10001	
U000002	| sio:Urine | 10002	
U000003	| sio:Urine | 10003	
U000004	| sio:Blood | 10004	
U000005	| sio:Blood | 10005	
U000006	| sio:Blood | 10006	

The __originalID__ and __rdf:type__ columns are exactly the same kinds of columns explained in STEP 3 of this session. The third column is required because of how the __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__ was created in the __SDD sheet__ saying that it is in the scope of __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__. In this case, the object "U000001" defined in this SOC is a sample of the Human object defined in __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__ (see STEP 3 above).

## 5.3.3. SSD Verification Rules

### SSD-Level Rule 1    
There must be a sheet named "SSD" in the SSD file which contains the object collection (OC) level definitions and relations.   
__Consequence of breaking the rule__:  HADatAc will stop processing the SSD file and an error message will be raised in the LOG file.  
__Error message__: “Missing SSD sheet in the xxx (name of the SSD) file.”  
__Correction__: check if the indicated DASA in the DM is correctly defined with attribute-object relationships 

### SSD-Level Rule 2    
The SSD should not contain special characters that can not be parsed (non-ASCII), cells with only white spaces and invisible extra rows.  
__Consequence of breaking the rule__:  HADatAc will stop processing the SSD file and an error message will be raised in the LOG file.  
__Error message__: “Row "XXX" and Cell "XXX" contains illegal content that can not be parsed.”  
__Correction__: Either update or delete the illegal content. 

### SSD-Level Rule 3    
The "sheet" column in the "SSD" sheet are synced with the other sheet names in the SSD.  
__Consequence of breaking the rule__:  HADatAc will stop processing the SSD file and an error message will be raised in the LOG file.  
__Error message__: “The "XXX" sheet can not be found in the SSD.”  
__Correction__: Check if the "sheet" column in the "SSD" sheet are synced with the other sheet names in the SSD. 

#### SSD-Level Rule 4    
Namespaces of URIs used in the SDD must be registered in HADatAc.  
__Consequence of breaking the rule__:  HADatAc will stop processing the SSD file and an error message will be raised in the LOG file.  
__Error message__: “The following namespaces in the Dictionary Mapping has unregistered namespace in cells: xxx”  
__Correction__: If the namespace is misspelled, correct it. If the namespace is correct, verify if it is included in namespaces.properties  

### SSD-Level Rule 5    
The OC sheets that contain Study Objects should follow the schema "originalID,rdf:type,scopeID,timeScopeID"  
__Consequence of breaking the rule__:  HADatAc will stop processing the SSD file and an error message will be raised in the LOG file.  
__Error message__: “originalID/rdf:type/scopeID/timeScopeID can not be found”.  
__Correction__:
