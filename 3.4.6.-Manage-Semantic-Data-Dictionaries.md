## How semantic data dictionaries (SDDs) are created

There is one way of creating an SDD: 

* by writing an SDD file as described in [Section 5.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.1.-Deployment-Specification-(DPL)) and manually submitting the DPL file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-submission-of-data-file-for-ingestion). 

__Hint__: An SDD file, which is an spreadsheet file, can be entirely created outside of HADatAc using an ordinary spreadsheet editing tool like MS Excel, or entirely created inside of HADatAc using the SDD Editor of Working Files (See Section 3.3.2). For small SDD files (with 10 or less attributes), our recommendation is to develop SDDs inside of HADatAc because of the SDD Editor mechanisms to select terms and verify the SDDs. For larger SDD files, we understand that it may be more flexible to edit SDDs outside of HADatAc. In this case, our suggestion is the partially edit SDDs outside of HADatAc but still use the internal editor to select terms, and more importantly, to verify SDDs. In this hybrid scenario, the upload and download operations of Working Files should be used to switch editing environment.
