This tutorial guides new HADataC user through the execution of ten typical tasks when interacting with the framework.

## 1. Log in as an administrator

When initially installed, HADataC comes with one user with administrative permission. The user's email address is **hadatac_org.aol.com**, and the password is **admin**. We recommend that you log as the administrator and replace the password. 

Be careful with this specific password because there is no way of resetting it without erasing the data repository, or completing the configuration of the emailer for the HADataC, which is beyond of the scope of the tutorial.
