This tutorial guides new HADataC users through the execution of eleven tasks that shows how the framework handles data and its metadata, and how the framework may help these users to manage and take advantage of integrated, combined collections of data and metadata.

## 1. Registering as a Data Owner

When initially installed, HADataC comes with one user with administrative permission. The user's email address is **hadatac_org@aol.com**, and the password is **admin**. We recommend that you log as the administrator and replace the password. 

Be careful with this specific password because there is no way of resetting it without erasing the data repository, or completing the configuration of the emailer for the HADataC, which is beyond of the scope of the tutorial.
