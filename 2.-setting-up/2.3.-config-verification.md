# 2.3.-Config-Verification

Six values are used to verify if a current HADatAc installation is up-to-date:

* Short name of the current HADatAC installation
* Code's version
* Name of the latest namespaces.properties file loaded, if any
* Base ontology's prefix
* Base ontology's namespace
* Version of the loaded base ontology, if any

These six values are accurately gathered and show using the version link available at the bottom of the HADatAc's homepage. The figure below shows where the link is located on the homepage.

And the figure below shows the output of selecting the link, which includes the six values for a given HADatAc installation.

The six values in the figure above come from the following sources:

* Short name of the current HADatAC installation comes from hadatac.conf
* Code's version is hardcoded inside of HADatAc code
* Name of the latest namespaces.properties file loaded is recorded at the time the namespaces.properties file was processed
* Base ontology's prefix comes from hadatac.conf
* Base ontology's namespace comes from the namespaces.properties file using the prefix from the base ontology from hadatac.conf
* Version of the loaded base ontology comes from the actual content of the base ontology loaded into HADatAc's graph database
