Data Preparation button next to a newly uploaded DA-* file becomes available when there is no object access specification available to process the file. In this case, in order to ingest the file, the Data Preparation button should be selected and the form needs to be completed.

The screenshot above shows the the Data Preparation Form, which is basically a workflow for acquiring metadata required for ingesting the data. For instance, under the current configuration of this specific repository, a data file may be associated with the following:

* A Study identification associated with the data file of concern. 

* Semantic Object Collection (SOC) identifies how entities involved with a study are organized as collections of tangible objects (e.g., subjects, samples) and collections of contextual objects (e.g., categories, time events, locations). The figure below shows how SOCs are defined and managed in our infrastructure.
 
* Scoping semantic objects identify which of the SOCs of a study may be associated with the image being loaded. In this case, the scoping objects may be an entire collection requiring the file to contain some form of identifier.   

  * Deployments identify how Instruments used to collect data are deployed at a given Platform. The platform may be a 
    laboratory that gives an instrument its necessary operational conditions, and it can also be a person wearing some 
    sensor. It is relevant to note that we consider a very broad notion of instrument since we see Questionnaires and 
    Computer Simulation Models as forms of instruments. Traditional instruments like an MRI machine are instances of 
    Physical Instrument.  

  * Semantic Data Dictionaries (SDDs) are use to specify both the meaning of the content of an image as well as to identify 
    how the file is organized. The figure below shows the  example of an SDD where each field of the data dictionary is 
    assigned to a collection of ontological terms identifying what is the type of entity behind of the image, what is the 
    attribute of the entity being measured, what is the unit of measurement, when, where, and at which accuracy the 
    measurement is made. 

The following screenshot provides more details about how each one of the SDD fields is edit according to terms coming from an integrated knowledge graph. The tabs on the right allow SDD developers to browse and select terms from the hierarchy of entities, attributes and units. Additional contextual knowledge such as the association of the current field to other temporal and spatial fields is done in the form on the left side of the image.
