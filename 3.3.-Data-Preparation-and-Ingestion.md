Data Preparation button next to a newly uploaded DA-* file becomes available when there is no object access specification available to process the file. In this case, in order to ingest the file, the Data Preparation button should be selected and the form needs to be completed.

## 3.3.1. Data File's Associated Elements

The screenshot above shows the the Data Preparation Form, which is basically a workflow for acquiring metadata required for ingesting the data. For instance, under the current configuration of this specific repository, a data file may be associated with the following:

* A Study associated with the data file of concern. This is often the study that originally funded the effort of acquiring the data which may include the acquisition and deployment of instruments, the execution of simulation models, and the effort of conducting questionnaires with human subjects.  

* Object(s) and/or object collection(s) associated with the values included in the data file of concern.

* An associated deployment describing the instrument and sensors used to acquire the data, as well as the exact conditions in which the instruments where deployed, e.g., associated _standard operating procedure_. 

* An associated Semantic Data Dictionary describing how the contents of the data file are going to be parsed and semantically annotated in terms of attributes and units. 

## 3.3.2. Workflow

The process of filling up this form consists of either selecting an existing OAS or identifying all the associated elements. The option of selecting an OAS is first one on the top of the form under "Select Complete and Active Data Acquisition".

If no OAS is appropriate for the file of concern, then it becomes require to fill out the rest of the form. Selected elements are already shown. Buttons are available for elements that have not been selected yet. For the screenshot above, we see that just the associated object(s)/object collection(s) have not been selected.

Once all required elements have been identified, the
