## 4.3.1. Semantic Study Design (SDD)

### 4.3.1.1. When to Use an SDD**  
Objects that are identified during the design of a study are strong candidates to go inside of an SSD file. If all identified objects in a study are either subjects and samples from the subject, it may be simpler to use PID and MAP files instead of SDD files for that study

### 4.3.1.2. How to Build an SSD**
The description of a study and further interaction with study's Principal Investigator(s) is the main way of acquiring the knowledge required to build an SSD. By inspecting available documentation and knowledge about a given study, we described 
the construction of an SSD as a four step process:

**Step 1: Identify Semantic Object Collections (SOC)**  

**Step 2: Identify Relationships Among SOCs**  

**Step 3: Identify Study Objects for each SOC**  

**Step 4: Mapping Study Objects from Related SOCS**
