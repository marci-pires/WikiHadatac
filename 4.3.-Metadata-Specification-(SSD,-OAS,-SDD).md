This section describes the three semantic metadata specifications used to describe a study's data content: Semantic Study Design (SSD), Object Access Specification (OAS), and Semantic Data Dictionary (SDD). 

## 4.3.1. Semantic Study Design (SSD)

### 4.3.1.1. When to Use an SSD  
Objects identified during the design of a study are strong candidates to go inside of an SSD file. If all identified objects in a given study are either subjects and subjects' samples, the use of PID and MAP files, as described in [Section 3.4.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.4.-Metadata-Ingest#3421-types-of-metadata-content-files), may be a simpler approach. 

### 4.3.1.2. How to Build an SSD
Written study descriptions of a study is a main way of acquiring knowledge required to build an SSD. Personal interaction with study's Principal Investigator(s) is another way of improving someone's understanding of a study design. By inspecting available documentation and knowledge about a given study, one should be able to follow the four-step process described below to construct a study's SSD:

**Step 1: Identify Semantic Object Collections (SOC)**  
Objects with explicitly assigned identifiers are strong candidates to be grouped into Semantic Object Collections (SOCs). For example, _Participant IDs (PIDs)_ are assigned to subjects, we expect that at least one SOC is created for subjects. If subjects are separated into groups, it is possible to encode each subject group as a new SOC. Further, let say that samples are collected from these subjects, and that _Sample IDs (SIDs) are assigned to these samples. These samples may become new SOCs as well.

In the table below we show the __SSD sheet__ of an SSD for __Study A__. In the first row below the header, we have a definition of the study supported by this SSD. The URI of the study is often given by the STD file feeding study's info HADatAc. The rows below the study row are the two SOCs of __Study A__ : __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__ and __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The first column of the __SSD sheet__ identifies other SSD sheets where _object specific_ information can be found for each semantic object collection.  

sheet |	hasURI	| type	| isMemberOf | hasScope | hasTimeScope | hasSpaceScope | cardinality	| role
----- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -----------	| ----
| | kb:STD-A | hasco:Study | | | | | | 
#SOC-SUBJECTS | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS	| hasco:SubjectGroup | kb:STD-A | | | | 6 | ont:isSubjectOf
#SOC-SAMPLES | kb:SOC-SAMPLES | hasco:SampleCollection | kb:STD-A | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS | | | 1 | ont:isSampleOf


**Step 2: Identify Relationships Among SOCs**  
Relationships between SOCs can vary greatly from one study to another, that is one of the main reasons why a study may need to use an SSD file instead of using simpler PID and MAP files to describe its objects. When building a SSD, we need to identify relationships between SOCs identified in Step 1. 

In the SSD in Step 1, we observe that the __hasScope__ of samples is subjects collection (i.e., __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__). We further see that the subject's cardinality is 6 and that the sample's cardinality is 1. Since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC, the exact number of subjects is its cardinality of 6. Since samples are in the scope of subjects, the cardinality means that the SOC expects to have one sample for each subject (1 x 6) for a total of six samples.

The role's column specifies the role of study objects. The SSD specifies __ont:isSubjectOf__ meaning that each object is a __ont:isSubjectOf__ the object representing the study since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC. For samples, however, we observe that each sample is __ont:isSampleOf__ of a subject object. These mappings are further specified in the object-level sheets of the SSD.

SDD is described in [Section 3.4.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#433-semantic-data-dictionary-sdd).

**Step 3: Identify Study Objects for each SOC**  

The table below shows the __#SUBJECT__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__. The sheet contains a list of the study-specific identifier and type of each object in the collection. Objects in the list specified for positions beyond the cardinality specified for the SOC are ignored. 

orignalID | rdf:type 
--- | -------- 
10001 | sio:Human
10002 | sio:Human
10003 | sio:Human
10004 | sio:Human
10005 | sio:Human
10006 | sio:Human

**Step 4: Mapping Study Objects from Related SOCS**  

The table below shows the __#SAMPLE__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The sheet contains a list of the study-specific identifier and type of each object, plus one _hasScopeID. This extra column is needed to map each sample to each subject. Broadly speaking, one hasScopeID is needed for each scope identified in the SDD sheet of the SDD. 

originalID | rdf:type | hasScopeID
---------- | -------- | ----------
U000001	| kb:Urine | 10001	
U000002	| kb:Urine | 10002	
U000003	| kb:Urine | 10003	
U000004	| kb:Urine | 10004	
U000005	| kb:Urine | 10005	
U000006	| kb:Urine | 10006	

## 4.3.2. Object Access Specification (OAS) 

## 4.3.3. Semantic Data Dictionary (SDD)

The SDD is made up of five tables: __InfoSheet__, __Dictionary Mapping__, __Code Mapping__, __Timeline__, and __Codebook__.

**Infosheet**  
The Infosheet is used to organize the other four tables named above. An example Infosheet template is shown below.

Attribute       |	Value
--------------- | ------------
SDD_Name	| Name
Dictionary_Mappings | #DICT
Codebook	| #CODEBOOK
Code_Mappings	| #CODEMAPPING
Timeline	| #TIMELINE
Imports	        | http://example.org/myontology/

We often encode SDDs using either a collection of Google Documents or a single Excel Spreadsheet. When using Google Docs, the values in the InfoSheet are URLs to other Google Docs containing the corresponding SDD specification. In Excel, we use the __#__ sign followed with the name of the sheet within the Spreadsheet that contains the corresponding SDD specification. 

**Dictionary Mappings**  

The bulk of the SDD specification is done using the Dictionary Mapping Table, which is used to annotate the columns of a given dataset. The SDD Data Model (DM) Specification is shown below.

DM              | Column                |	Description
--------------- |  -------------------- | --------------------------- 
Attribute	| rdf:type	        | Class of attribute entry
attributeOf	| sio:isAttributeOf	| Entity having the attribute
Column		| Entry                 | column header in dataset
Comment	        | rdfs:comment	        | Comment for the entry
Definition	| skos:definition	| Entry text definition
Entity	        | rdf:type	        | Class of entity entry
Format	        |	                | Specifies the structure of the Unit value
inRelationTo	| sio:inRelationTo	| Entity that the role is linked to
Label	        | rdfs:label	        | Label for the entry
Relation        |		        | Custom relation that replaces inRelationTo
Role	        | sio:hasRole	        | Type of the role of the entry
Time	        | sio:existsAt	        | Time point of measurement
Unit	        | sio:hasUnit	        | Unit of Measure for entry
wasDerivedFrom	| prov:wasDerivedFrom	| Entity from which the entry was derived
wasGeneratedBy	| prov:wasGeneratedBy	| Activity from which the entry was produced

**Codebook**  
The Codebook table contains possible values of coded variables and their associated labels. For variables with discrete values, when appropriate, we augment each possible value with mappings to corresponding concepts, as shown in the table below.

Column	| Code |	Label	| Class
------- | ---- | -------------- | -----
race	| 0	| white	  | kb:White
race	| 1	| black	  | kb:AfricanAmerican
race	| 2	| other	  | kb:OtherRace
smoke	| 0	| no smoking |	kb:NonSmoker
smoke	| 1	| some smoking | kb:Smoker

**Timeline**  
Customized time intervals can be specified in the Timeline sheet, which can be used to annotate the corresponding class and unit related to a given entry, as well start and end times of an event, and a connection to concepts that the entry may be related to. An example timeline is shown below.

Name	| Label	        | Type     | Start | End   | Unit     |	inRelationTo
------- | ------------- | -------- | ------| ----- | -------- | ------------------- 
??visit1 |	Visit 1	| kb:Visit | 10.1  | 19.9  | sio:Week | ??baseline
??visit2 |	Visit 2	| kb:Visit | 20.0  | 32.0  | sio:Week | ??baseline
