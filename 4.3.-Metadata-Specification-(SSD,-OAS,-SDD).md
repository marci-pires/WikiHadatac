## 4.3.1. Semantic Study Design (SDD)

### 4.3.1.1. When to Use an SSD  
Objects that are identified during the design of a study are strong candidates to go inside of an SSD file. If all identified objects in a study are either subjects and subjects' samples, the use of PID and MAP files may be a simpler approach. 

PID and MAP files are described in [Section 3.4.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.4.-Metadata-Ingest#3421-types-of-metadata-content-files).

### 4.3.1.2. How to Build an SSD
The description of a study and further interaction with study's Principal Investigator(s) is the main way of acquiring the knowledge required to build an SSD. By inspecting available documentation and knowledge about a given study, we described 
the construction of an SSD as a four-step process:

**Step 1: Identify Semantic Object Collections (SOC)**  
Objects that are explicitly identified in a study are strong candidates to be grouped into Semantic Object Collections (SOCs). For example, if subjects are given Participant IDs (PIDs), we expect that at least one SOC is created for subjects. If subjects within a group are grouped, it is possible to encode each group of subjects as a new SOC. Further, let say that samples are also collected from these subjects, and that samples are also identified within the study with the use of sample identifiers (SIDs). These samples may become new SOCs.

In the table below we show the __SSD sheet__ of an SSD for __Study A__. The first row below the header, we have a definition of the study supported by this SSD. The URI of the study is often given by the STD file feeding study's info HADatAc. The rows below the study row are the two SOCs of __Study A__ : __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__ and __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The first column identifies the sheet of the SSD where object specific information can be found for each object collection.  

sheet |	hasURI	| type	| isMemberOf | hasScope | hasTimeScope | hasSpaceScope | cardinality	| role
----- | ------- | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -----------	| ----
| | kb:STD-A | hasco:Study | | | | | | 
#SOC-SUBJECTS | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS	| hasco:SubjectGroup | kb:STD-A | | | | 6 | ont:isSubjectOf
#SOC-SAMPLES | kb:SOC-SAMPLES | hasco:SampleCollection | kb:STD-A | kb:SOC-SUBJECTS | | | 1 | ont:isSampleOf


**Step 2: Identify Relationships Among SOCs**  
Relationships between SOCs can vary greatly from one study to another, that is why a study may need to use SSD instead of simpler PID and MAP files to describe its objects. When building a SSD, we need to identify relationships between SOCs identified in Step 1. 

In the SSD in Step 1, we observe that the __hasScope__ of samples is subjects collection (i.e., __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__). We further see that the subject's cardinality is 6 and that the sample's cardinality is 1. Since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC, the exact number of subjects is its cardinality of 6. Since samples are in the scope of subjects, the cardinality means that the SOC expects to have one sample for each subject (1 x 6) for a total of six samples.

The role's column specifies the role of study objects. The SSD specifies __ont:isSubjectOf__ meaning that each object is a __ont:isSubjectOf__ the object representing the study since subjects are not in the scope of any other SOC. For samples, however, we observe that each sample is __ont:isSampleOf__ of a subject object. These mappings are further specified in the object-level sheets of the SSD.

SDD is described in [Section 3.4.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#433-semantic-data-dictionary-sdd).

**Step 3: Identify Study Objects for each SOC**  

The table below shows the __#SUBJECT__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SUBJECTS__. The sheet contains a list of the study-specific identifier and type of each object in the collection. Objects in the list specified for positions beyond the cardinality specified for the SOC are ignored. 

orignalID | rdf:type 
--- | -------- 
10001 | sio:Human
10002 | sio:Human
10003 | sio:Human
10004 | sio:Human
10005 | sio:Human
10006 | sio:Human

**Step 4: Mapping Study Objects from Related SOCS**  

The table below shows the __#SAMPLE__ sheet describing the study objects inside of __kb:SOC-SAMPLES__. The sheet contains a list of the study-specific identifier and type of each object, plus one _hasScopeID. This extra column is needed to map each sample to each subject. Broadly speaking, one hasScopeID is needed for each scope identified in the SDD sheet of the SDD. 

originalID | rdf:type | hasScopeID
---------- | -------- | ----------
U000001	| kb:Urine | 10001	
U000002	| kb:Urine | 10002	
U000003	| kb:Urine | 10003	
U000004	| kb:Urine | 10004	
U000005	| kb:Urine | 10005	
U000006	| kb:Urine | 10006	

## 4.3.2. Object Access Specification (OAS) 

## 4.3.3. Semantic Data Dictionary (SDD)

The SDD is made up of five tables: InfoSheet, Dictionary Mapping, Code Mapping tables, Timeline, and the Codebook.

**Infosheet**  
The Infosheet is used to organize these tables, and contains information about the scientific study, such as the name, identifier, or link to the study description, in addition to the location of the other SDD tables. An example Infosheet template is shown below.

Attribute |	Value
--------- | ------------
Study_Name	| Example Study
Study_ID	| 1
Study_Link	| http://...
Dictionary_Mappings | http://...
Codebook	| http://...
Code_Mappings	| http://...
Timeline	| http://...
Imports	| http://hadatac.org/ont/chear/

**Dictionary Mappings** 

The bulk of the annotation is done using the Dictionary Mapping Table, which is used to annotate the columns of a given dataset. The SDD DM Specification is shown below.

DM  | Column |	Related Property | 	Description
--- |  ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- 
Attribute	| rdf:type	| Class of attribute entry
attributeOf	| sio:isAttributeOf	| Entity having the attribute
Column		| Entry | column header in dataset
Comment	| rdfs:comment	| Comment for the entry
Definition	| skos:definition	| Entry text definition
Entity	| rdf:type	| Class of entity entry
Format	|	| Specifies the structure of the Unit value
inRelationTo	| sio:inRelationTo	| Entity that the role is linked to
Label	| rdfs:label	| Label for the entry
Relation |		| Custom relation that replaces inRelationTo
Role	| sio:hasRole	| Type of the role of the entry
Time	| sio:existsAt	| Time point of measurement
Unit	| sio:hasUnit	| Unit of Measure for entry
wasDerivedFrom	| prov:wasDerivedFrom	| Entity from which the entry was derived
wasGeneratedBy	| prov:wasGeneratedBy	| Activity from which the entry was produced

**Codebook**
The Codebook table contains possible values of coded variables and their associated labels. For variables with discrete values, when appropriate, we augment each possible value with mappings to corresponding concepts, as shown in the table below.

Column	Code	Label	Class
race	0	white	chear:White
race	1	black	chear:BlackOrAfricanAmerican
race	2	other	chear:OtherRace
edu	0	high school degree or less	chear:HighSchoolOrLess
edu	1	technical college or some college	chear:SomeCollege
edu	2	college graduate	chear:CollegeGraduate
edu	3	above	chear:AdvancedDegree
smoke	0	no smoking in pregnancy	chear:NonSmoker
smoke	1	some smoking in pregnancy	chear:Smoker
insur	0	private/hmo/self-pay	chear:NoPublicInsurance
insur	1	public	chear:PublicInsurance
Timeline
Customized time intervals can be specified in the Timeline sheet, which can be used to annotate the corresponding class and unit related to a given entry, as well start and end times of an event, and a connection to concepts that the entry may be related to. An example timeline is shown below.

Name	Label	Type	Start	End	Unit	inRelationTo
??visit1	Visit 1	chear:Visit	4.71	19.1	sio:Week	??conception
??visit2	Visit 2	chear:Visit	14.9	32.1	sio:Week	??conception
??visit3	Visit 3	chear:Visit	22.9	38.3	sio:Week	??conception
