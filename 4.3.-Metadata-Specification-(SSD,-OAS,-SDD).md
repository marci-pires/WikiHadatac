### 4.3.1.1. When to Use an SSD  
Objects that are identified during the design of a study are strong candidates to go inside of an SSD file. If all identified objects in a study are either subjects and samples from the subject, it may be simpler to use PID and MAP files instead of SDD files for that study

### 4.3.1.2. How to Build an SSD
The description of a study and further interaction with study's Principal Investigator(s) is the main way of acquiring the knowledge required to build an SSD. By inspecting available documentation and knowledge about a given study, we described 
the construction of an SSD as a four step process:

**Step 1: Identify Semantic Object Collections (SOC)**  
Objects that are explicitly identified in a study are strong candidates to be grouped into Semantic Object Collections (SOCs). For example, if subjects are given Participant IDs, we expect that at least of SOC is created for subjects. If subjects within a group are grouped, it is possible to encode each group of subjects as a new SOC. Further, let say that samples are also collected from these samples, and that samples are also identified within the study with the use of sample identifiers (SIDs). These samples may become new SOCs.

**Step 2: Identify Relationships Among SOCs**  
Relationships between SOCs can vary greatly from one study to another, that is why a study may need to use SSD instead of simpler PID and MAP files to describe its objects. When building a SSD, we need to identify relationships between SOCs identified in Step 1.

**Step 3: Identify Study Objects for each SOC**  

**Step 4: Mapping Study Objects from Related SOCS**
