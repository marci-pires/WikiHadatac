# HADataC Documentation

A significant amount of time and effort is often spent organizing data before the meaning of the data can be understood, enabling one to analyze the data and thus infer new knowledge. HADataC is an infrastructure that enables combined collection data and metadata in a way that collected metadata is properly and logically connected to collected data. HADataC data is scientific data measured in support of empirical scientific activities and/or data generated through computer simulation of modesl in support of computational scientific activities. HADataC metadata is a rich collection of contextual knowledge about scientific activities encoded and connected to the data through the use of semantic web technologies. This rich metadata collection is thus leveraged by the HADataC infrastructure to support the following: data management; data governance in terms of privacy, access and dissemination; uncertainty management; and data analytics activities currently referred to as just ''big data''.
