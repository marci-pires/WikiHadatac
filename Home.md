# HADataC Documentation

A significant amount of time and effort is often used to organize data before it can be analyzed. HADataC is an infrastructure that enables the collection of data with its metadata in a way that the metadata is properly connected with data. In fact, HADataC metadata is a rich collection of contextual knowledge encoded and connected to the data through the use of semantic web technologies. This rich metadata collection is them used to support data management, data governance in terms of privacy, access and dissemination, uncertainty management, and a rich collection of data analytics activities currently referred to as just ''big data''.
