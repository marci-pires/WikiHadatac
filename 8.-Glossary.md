* **data file** - A computer file containing data values
* **data quality type** - The exact condition under which data values are collected by measurement, elicitation (e.g., from a human) or generation (e.g., by computer simulation). A _standard operating procedure_ is a mechanism that laboratories use to assure that a given data acquisition process occur under a given data quality type  
* **DPL** - Deployment metadata file that also includes information about platforms, instruments and detectors
* **OAS** - Object Access Specification metadata file that links files to  studies and semantic data dictionaries
* **SDD** - Semantic Data Dictionary that semantically describes the contents of data acquisition files
* **SSD** - Semantic Study Design metadata file that identifies studies' objects of interest like subjects and samples and how they are related 
* **STD** - Study metadata file that describes basic properties of scientific studies including whether they are observations or experiments
