## How studies are created

There are two ways of creating a Study: 

* by using the __Create New Study__ button under Manage Studies (HOME > Manage Studies) or 
* by writing an STD file as described in [Section 5.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.2.-Study-Specification-(STD)) and manually submitting the STD file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-data-file-ingest).
