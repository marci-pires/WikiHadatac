This section describes six operations that enables an incremental evolution of the knowledge graph behind a HADatAc Installation without the need of recreating the knowledge graph from scratch when new studies are ingested. 

The focus of this section is to describe these operations from a system administrator's point of view rather than a point of view from a scientist or ontologist. For instance, we are concerned about how to replace an ontology A that is in version 1.3 to version 1.4. In this context, we are no interest in what are the differences between version 1.3 and 1.4, but that the content of version 1.3 needs to be replaced by the content of version 1.4.

The six operations are the following: 

* __Namespace list update__, which is described in [Section 6.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.1.-Namespace-List-Update)

* __Ontology update__, which is described in [Section 6.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.2.-Ontology-Update)

* __DPL specification file update__, which is described in [Section 6.3.]()

* __SSD file update__, which is described in [Section 6.4.]()

* __SDD file update__, which is described in [Section 6.5.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.5.-SDD-Update)
