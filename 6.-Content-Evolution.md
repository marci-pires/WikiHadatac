This section talks about how to proceed when a HADatAc installation is in production and some contents of HADatAc's underlying knowledge graph change. The focus of this section is operational rather than conceptual. For instance, this section talks about how to replace a based ontology that evolves from version 2.2 to 2.3 rather than to describe how to evolve a base ontology.
