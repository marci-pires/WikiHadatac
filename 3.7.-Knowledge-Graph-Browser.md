The Knowledge Graph (KG) Browser is a top-down graphical graphical interface that allows users to start from an overview of the KG with all its studies, to open a study to explore its objects (i.e., subjects, samples, locations), to open objects to explore its properties along with available property values.

The browser is invoked by going to "HOME > Knowledge Graph Browsing"
