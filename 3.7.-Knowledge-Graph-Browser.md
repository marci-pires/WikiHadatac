In HADatAc, a knowledge graph is incrementally created as part of the process of ingesting ontologies, metadata files, and data files. The Knowledge Graph Browser is a visualization aid that HADatAc uses to show its knowledge graph, allowing HADatAc users to dive into the graph starting from its high level building blocks like scientific studies and going down to data coming from data files. In this case, data from data files are often values of properties of objects directly or indirectly associated with studies.
