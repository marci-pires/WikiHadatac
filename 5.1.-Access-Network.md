## 5.1.1. Access Network Elements

Every HADatAc has one access network composed of 
* access levels and 
* users

HADatAcâ€™s access networks are initially composed of one default access level called __public__. Every user belongs to one access level, and is an access level on its own. For instance, if the access network is brand new, it only has the access level _public_. Therefore, if a new user _Carol_ is added, it is added under _public_. The figure above shows a more complete example of an access network where we see the node representing __Carol__ pointing to the __pulic__ node. This means that any data added by __Carol__ to HADatAc will initially belong to __Carol__ who will be the only user capable of accessing that data. If __Carol__ needs to share the data, __Carol__ can relax the restriction on the data by moving the access to the data to __public__. 

On the same way that users are added to an access network, new access level can also be added. Public is the less restricted level of access in the access network and the further an access level with respect to _public_ the more restricted it the access level.
