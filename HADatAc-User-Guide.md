The screenshot above shows HADatAcâ€™s Data Faceted Search where users go to select interactively select and download HADatAc content for analysis, including the possibility of data owners sharing their data with other users. 

We observe that scientific images would take central stage in the faceted search with image metadata being used to play multiple roles during the process of selecting and downloading images from the image repository. 

Facet Panel: Each property of images can be used as facets, where the actual selection of a facet is the selection of one or more possible values for each image. For instance, images may be selected by its source (a study, an image collection), by physical characteristics of the entities the image is from (part of a body, presence of some feature, known disease), by the instruments generating the images (e.g., MRI, CAT Scan), and so on.

Scientific Data Panel: It provides a preview of the images to be downloaded providing some contextual data like the IDs of the subjects and/or samples, temporal and spatial information.

Detail Panels: It provides more in-depth explanation about information that can be found on the facets and in the Scientific Data Panel, and such detailed information may contain links to actual external documents that enable a quick investigation from users on whether the current selection of the search corresponds to the actual data to downloaded from the repository of if further refinement/relaxation of the selection criteria is necessary.
