# 3.5.1-Data-Faceted-Search

The screenshot above shows HADatAcâ€™s Data Faceted Search where users go to select interactively select and download HADatAc content for analysis, including the possibility of data owners sharing their data with other users.

**Facet Panel**: Each property of data can be used as facets, where the actual selection of a facet is the selection of one or more possible values for each data point. For instance, data may be selected by its source \(a study, a data file\), by physical characteristics of entities that the data is from \(part of a body, presence of some feature, known disease\), by the instruments generating the data \(e.g., MRI, mass spectrometer, thermometer\), and so on.

**Scientific Data Panel**: It provides a preview of data to be downloaded providing some contextual information like the IDs of the subjects and/or samples, temporal and spatial information.

**Detail Panels**: It provides more in-depth explanation about information that can be found on the facets and in the Scientific Data Panel, and such detailed information may contain links to actual external documents that enable a quick investigation from users on whether the current selection of the search corresponds to the actual data to downloaded from the repository of if further refinement/relaxation of the selection criteria is necessary.
