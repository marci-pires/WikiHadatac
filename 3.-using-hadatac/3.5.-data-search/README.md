# 3.5.-Data-Search

## Data Search Purposes

Below we provide a brief list of purposes for data search

* Understand which kind of data is available, and thus which kind of data can be used to perform a study without the need of collecting new data
* Manage data acquired by a new/ongoing study, for instance, to verify that data has been acquired, curated, and properly annotated in support of studies
* Select data required to be analyzed and/or share with other data users

## How Does It Work?

A criteria needs to be established for retrieving and selecting data. In general, these criteria are based on data properties as well on properties from the data's metadata \(i.e., data about data\). As described in Section 3.5.1., [Faceted Data Search](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.5.1-Data-Faceted-Search) is used when a multi-variable criteria is required. If data's and metadata's properties are of spatial nature, a [Spatial Data Search](./) as described in Section 3.5.2. may be more useful.
