## How semantic data dictionaries are created

There are two ways of creating a semantic data dictionary:

* by using the **Create New Stream** button under Manage Stream \(HOME &gt; Manage Stream\) or 
* by writing an STR file as described in \[Section 5.4\]\([https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.4.-Stream-Specification-\(STR](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.4.-Stream-Specification-%28STR)\)\) and manually submitting the STR file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-data-file-ingest). 

## Semantic data dictionary operations

The semantic data dictionary management option supports the following operations:

* to view a data dictionary after being ingested
* to delete a semantic data dictionary
