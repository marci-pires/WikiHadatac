# 3.4.5 - Manage Streams

## How streams are created

There are two ways of creating a data stream:

* by using the **Create New Stream** button under Manage Stream \(HOME &gt; Manage Stream\) or 
* by writing an STR file as described in \[Section 5.5\]\([https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.5.-Stream-Specification-\(STR](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.5.-Stream-Specification-%28STR)\)\) and manually submitting the STR file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-submission-of-data-file-for-ingestion).

* to list existing streams
* to list past streams
* to pause/resume a stream
* to permanently close a stream
* to change the permission of who has access to the stream's data
