### 4.5.1. OAS Elements

OAS specifications identify resources necessary for processing content of CSV files. An OAS is a CSV file itself composed of one row of data (i.e., a record) composed of the following eight fields (columns):

Column Header   | Column Description
--------------- | ------------------
Study ID        | study 
da name         | a name-template for selecting incoming files 
data dict       | the data dictionary of choice for processing the file(s)
deployment uri  | URI of deployment originating data file's content 
cell scope      | cell level scope (see explanation below in this section)
owner email     | the email address of the person who is the actual owner of the data 
permission url  | permission policy for accessing the data

The data dictionary of the OAS identifies the SDD document that describes how objects identified during the parsing of the SDD file content map to object types. The precise identification of which object is mapped to each value is specified by the row-scope attribute and cell-scope attribute described below. 

### 4.5.2. Object Scoping

Objects need to be either instantiated of located in HADatAc's knowledge base to have values of their properties updated. 
Object scoping is needed for objects that already exists HADatAc, for example, objects created by SSD files. 

**Cell Scope**

The cell scope is a value assignment strategy used when values in rows of CSV files cannot be uniquely mapped to a single object type as combinations of direct and indirect attributes of the object type. In other words, cell scope is used when objects in a row belong to multiple objects that are not associated with each other through known semantic relationships. 

One special use of cell scope is when all the attributes of interest in a given file come from a single object. In this case, OAS allows the use of an asterisk (__*__) to represent all the attributes in the SDD. For example, if all the attributes in a given file are from kb:SUB07, the OAS for such file would be __cell-scope="<<*, kb:SUB07>>"__.

### 4.5.3. An OAS Example

Let assume that we have three files names DA-demographics001.csv, DA-demographics002.csv and DA-demographics003.csv, that the three files need to be processed by a common SDD named SDD-demographics.xsl, and that the data files are related to a common set of objects. Under these assumptions, one OAS file can be used to assign how content extracted from the files will be assigned to the common set of objects. 

Study ID  | da name      | data dict        | deployment uri | cell scope | owner email     | permission uri
--------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------------
2016-1234 | demographics | SDD-demographics | proj:quest     |            | joe@example.org | http://example\#team

The table above shows an example of how a semantic dada dictionary SDD-demographics is assigned to parse the content of the file starting with the name __DA-demographics__. In fact, the OAS specification assumes that any data file name starts with __DA-__ plus the data-file-name value in the OAS.  

The OAS above further specifies that joe@example.org is the email of the owner of the data content of any file that starts with the name __DA-demographics__, and that anyone with permission __http://example#team__ (according to HADatAc's data access policy) has access to content extracted from any file matching the data-file-name identified in the OAS.
