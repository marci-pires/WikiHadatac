# 1.3.-Installing-for-MacOS-\(OSX\)

A basic HADataC installation involves the following four steps:

* acquiring required software for installing/running the HADatAc Console
* downloading the HADataC Console code from this GitHub repository, and
* executing its installation script.

The instructions below describe how to obtain and install these components, and test if the installation is working properly.

## Step 1: Acquiring Required Software

### Open terminal

Easiest method is to hit `command+spacebar > type > terminal > enter`. This should open a terminal window that looks like a scary box where you put code.

### Install homebrew

Instructions for installation can be found here: [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)

OR copy and paste this command in terminal:

```text
 ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install sbt

In terminal type:

```text
 brew install sbt
```

Let that install. You may be prompted to install the xcode command line tools. If so click `install` and let the installation finish before installing sbt again.

### Install tar

In terminal type:

```text
 brew install tar
```

### Install wget

In terminal type:

```text
 brew install wget
```

### Install git

In terminal type:

```text
 brew install git
```

### Intall Java SDK 1.8+

Go to: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) Find the version you need \(most likely for mac\).

#### Download Java

Double click the orange package and install. CHECK YOUR VERSION \(on the terminal\):

```text
javac -version 
```

You should see Java 1.8.0, the version you have just downloaded. If not, you had a previous version. Proceed with the following steps to fix it:

Run the following:

```text
  /usr/libexec/java_home -V
```

Check the versions and run:

```text
 export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v <<java1.8 version from above>>`
```

Add the above line to the file ~/.bashrc to make the change permanent

## Step 2: Cloning HADatAc-Console

On the terminal, go to your home directory by typing the following \(`cd` is change directory\) :

```text
  cd ~
```

Once your are in your home directory \(`~` is a shortcut for your home directory\), clone HADatAc code by typing the following command:

```text
  git clone https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac.git
```

After cloning HADatAC, you should have a hadatac folder under your home directory. Go into the hadatac directory under your home directory by typing the following:

```text
 cd ~/hadatac
```

If youâ€™re lost type:

```text
 pwd 
```

to find out where you are. If you want to list all the files and folders around you type:

```text
 ls 
```

If you want to get back to the start just type:

```text
 cd
```

## Step 3: Installing HADatAc

Once you are in the hadatac folder \(you can check if you are in the right folder by typing `pwd`\), type the following:

```text
  ./install_hadatac.sh
```

This process will take a while so let it run. It will copy the files, download and install the two SOLR instances required by HADatAc, and initialize the instances.

During the process of executing the script, you will be asked for an installation folder. If possible, just accept the installation folder suggested by the script. If not, specify a different installation directory. Keep note of what is your installation file since you will need to use it in the next step.

The script downloads JETTY and put it into hadatac-blazegraph directory by default. We start JETTY to run BLAZEGRAPH at localhost:8080/blazegraph. Before starting JETTY, we need to set the path of the journal file of BLAZEGRAPH for storing triples. To do this, open the RWStore.properties file under {BASE\_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/webapps/blazegraph/WEB-INF/classes and change the configuration as follows

```text
 com.bigdata.journal.AbstractJournal.file={BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/blazegraph.jnl
```

Replace the BASE\_DIR with path according to your local environment. Please use absolute path for this setting. To start JETTY, run

```text
 sh {BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/bin/jetty.sh start
```

Open your browser to verify if the SOLR installations were successful

* Open another tab with the url: [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/)

And verify if the BLAZEGRAPH installations were successful,

* Open another tab with the url: [http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/](http://localhost:8080/blazegraph/)

To create required namespaces for hadatac triplestore, run

```text
 sh ./create_namespaces.sh
```

If you want to stop JETTY to stop BLAZEGRAPH, run

```text
 sh {BASE_DIR}/hadatac-blazegraph/jetty-distribution-9.4.12.v20180830/bin/jetty.sh stop
```

## Step 4: Running HADatAc

Go back to terminal, and go to your installation folder by typing the following, after making sure that you replace the `(your hadatac installation directory)` by your actual hatadac installation directory:

```text
 cd (your hadatac installation directory)
```

Now type the following:

```text
 sbt
```

Note:Navigate to the hadatac folder using cd in the terminal window, before typing sbt This step will take a long time the first time.

In the terminal window you should see `[hadatac]` In the terminal window type:

```text
 run
```

Wait for confirmation message that the project is running.

Browser open hadatac url: [http://localhost:9000/hadatac/](http://localhost:9000/hadatac/)

Wait for page to open, it will take a while.
