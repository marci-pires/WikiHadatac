## 5.1.1. Purpose of DPL files   
Deployment (DPL) files are used to register instruments, platforms, and the deployment of instruments at platforms. Instruments also rely on detectors that are used to capture signals that instruments translate into values.  

## 5.1.2. Understanding DPL Content   

In order to understand how to visualize measured data, one is required to understand instrument metadata (e.g. sensor metadata). There are two high-level questions that one need to understand sensor metadata:
* Where the instruments are deployed? 
* If remote sensing is used, what is the field of view of each instrument?

### 5.1.2.1 Instrument (sensors) Location   
In the area of scientific visualization, one would rely on the geometry (the spatial structure of the object) of the data.

For measurement data, we would like to focus on scientific visualizations. Which means we need to not only get the measurement data but also get the geometry of the data. Through the use of DPL files, we will be able to collect the geometry of the data through the Platform" service and actual measurement data from "measurement" service. 

The definition of the platform can be variance, here are some features of the platform:
1. The platform can be either static or dynamic (e.g a room with a light sensor or a human with step counting equipment)
2. Most platform has three dimensions (Euclidean space), a static data would fix its corresponding dimension. For instance, if we have point with (x,y) coordinates, it can only move up and down in that very spot.
3. The platform can be decomposed into sub-Platforms (building into floors, floors into rooms/walls/etc). Vice versa, a platform can also have its super-platforms.
4. If a certain platform doesn't have its own coordinates, it will inherit from the corresponding super-platform.
5. The coordinate system may be different between the sub and the super platforms.
6. The platform has layout: in Hadatac, if we find latitude and longitude, the layout is the Earth, otherwise, we need to find the reference layout of the platform.

With some basic concepts above, we should have a clearer idea about how to locate the instruments now.

## Define the type of sensors
In general, two types of sensors exist local sensing or remote sensing.

### If local sensing:
If the local sensor is used, the location of the data is at the platform where the instrument acquiring the data is deployed(e.g temperature sensor). Since it is collecting the data from those points, we are good and don't need to consider the field of view.

### If remote sensing:
If a remote sensor is used, the location of the data is in the 3D area called 'field of view' of the sensor, in this case, we need to use the measurement API to get the information. Currently, it is an elicit data(someone measured for us) so notice potential mistakes may exist since it is not as reliable as measurement data.
