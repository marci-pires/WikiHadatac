# 3.5.2.-Data-Spatial-Search

## When to Use Spatial Search

Spatial search is used when the initial criteria for retrieving the data is based on locations:

* '''where is the data from that building?'''
* '''where is the data from that weather station located right on the edge of the lake?'''
* '''what are the data from labs located in New Mexico?'''

## How to Search for the Data?

The search is spatial since one will need to go the map and locate platforms located in the place of interest:

* in a world map, zoom in into the building of interest
* in a world map, zoom in into the lake of interest
* in a world map, locate the US State of New Mexico
