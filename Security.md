## User Categories and Console Functionality Permissions

HADataC users can be unregistered, pre-registered, or registered. Anyone visiting a HADataC website is initially considered an unregistered user. A user who is registered in HADatac is capable of logging into the system as a data owner. A data owner with admin permission is called an administration (or admin) user.
 
### Administration user

One standard administration user is automatically created during a HADataC installation. This is the admin user who can pre-register new users and grant admin user status to other registered users. A user is said to be a pre-registered if the user is included into the HADataC metadata repository as a PROV Agent with the name and email addresses filled out.   

### Data owner

A user is said to be registered if the user signed up and confirmed the authenticity of its email address by following the link in the email message sent by HADataC after the user has requested Registered users are data owners, which mean, they are capable of including data into HADataC.
