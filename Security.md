## User Categories and Console Functionality Permissions

Users are either unregistered, pre-registered, or registered. A registered user is one who went through the process of signing up for the system and confirming the authenticity of its email address. A registered user is capable of logging into the system, add data into the system, remove her data from the system, accessing her data, and changing the permission of who can access her data. A registered user may be an admin user if an admin user has granted the registered user admin permission. A user can only sign up to become a registered user if the user was previously pre-registered into the system by an administrator user. 
 
### Administration user

One standard administration user is automatically created during a HADataC installation. This is the admin user who can pre-register new users and grant admin user status to other registered users. A user is said to be a pre-registered if the user is included into the HADataC metadata repository as a PROV Agent with the name and email addresses filled out.   

### Data owner

Every registered user is considered a data owner, whether the use actually owns or not any data in the data repository. A data owner is capable of the following: uploading data and metadata into the system; recording deployment metadata; annotating data with metadata; setting the permission of who has the right of accessing their data; deleting their data from the system.  

### Guest user

Every user is considered unregistered until the user logs into the system. Unregistered users can access and download publicly available data. Unregistered users cannot upload and own data in the HADataC system.
