The abbreviated name of the base ontology is needed to update it.  The base ontology's abbreviated name is available under "HOME > Manage Repository" (see [Section 2.3.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.3.-Config-Verification)).

Ontology update is done inside of Manage Ontology ("HOME > Manage Ontology"). 

Look for the "Namespace Management" table, and inside the table, look for the row of the base ontology, i.e., the one that has the abbreviated name of the base ontology. The Namespace Management table is incorrect if the base ontology cannot be located inside of the table. Revisit [Section 2.1.5]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties) to verify that the namespace property list for the project is correctly loaded.

To update the base ontology, it is required to select the recycle icon inside of "Actions." In the figure above, the recycle action is shown for a base ontology called "chear." When selecting the recycle button, the recycle action will do the following:

* Remove all content from HADatAc's knowledge graph that was added the last time the base ontology was loaded
* Reinsert the content from the selected ontology, as located in the namespace properties file, into the knowledge graph. The ontology is going to be loaded from the loading URL (fifth column) in the Namespace Management table. 

___Hint 1___: When an update occurs, it is very unusual for the total number of triples of the previous and the current version of the ontology to be the same. The number of triples of a given ontology is shown in the "No. of Triples Loaded" column of the Namespace Management table. Thus, if the number of triples loaded changes to some value different than zero after pressing the recycle button, this is a strong indication that the ontology was updated.

___Hint 2___: In most cases, the number of triples will go up, but it is possible that the number of triples can go down. 

___Hint 3___: If the number of triples loaded after the update is zero (0), this is a strong indication that the update failed. In this case, it is recommended to first retry pressing the recycle option, and if the process is still failing, to restart or initiate the knowledge graph.
