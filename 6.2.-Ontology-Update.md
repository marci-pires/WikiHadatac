The abbreviated name of the base ontology is needed to update it.  The base ontology's abbreviated name is available under "HOME > Manage Repository" (see [Section 2.3.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.3.-Config-Verification)).

Ontology update is done inside of Manage Ontology ("HOME > Manage Ontology"). 

Look for the "Namespace Management" table, and inside the table, look for the row of the base ontology, i.e., that has the abbreviated name of the base ontology. The Namespace Management table is incorrect if the base ontology cannot be located inside of the table. Revisit [Section 2.1.5]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties) to verify that the namespace properly list for the project is correctly loaded.

To update the base ontology, it is required to select the recycle's icon inside of "Actions". When selecting the recycle action action, it will do the following:

* remove all the content (triples) in the knowledge base that were added during the last time the base ontology was loaded
* reinsert the content (triples) from the ontology as located in the namespace properties file into the knowledge base

___Hint 1___: When an update occurs, it is very unusual for the total number of triples of the previous and the current version of the ontology to be the same. Thus, if the value changes, it indicates that the ontology was updated

___Hint 2___: In most cases, the number of triples will go up, but it is possible that the number of triples can go down. 

___Hint 3___: If the number of triples after the update is zero (0), that is a strong indication the update failed.
