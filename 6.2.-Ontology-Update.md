To update a base ontology update, it is needed the abbreviated name of the base ontology to be updated.  The base ontology's abbreviated name is available under "HOME > Manage Repository" (see [Section 2.3.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.3.-Config-Verification)).

Ontology update is done inside Manage Ontology ("HOME > Manage Ontology"). Look for the "Namespace Management" table, and inside the table, look for the row of the base ontology, i.e., that has the abbreviated name of the base ontology. If the base ontology cannot be located inside the Namespace Management table, please revisit [Section 2.1.5]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.1.-Software-Configuration#215-setting-up-namespacesproperties).
