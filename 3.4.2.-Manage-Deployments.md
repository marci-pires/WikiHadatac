## How Deployments are Created

There is one way of creating a deployment: 

* by writing a DPL specification file with a __deployment__ sheet as described in [Section 5.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.1.-Deployment-Specification-(DPL)) and manually submitting the DPL file for ingestion as described in [Section 3.2.1]( https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/3.2.-Manage-Data-File-Ingestion#321-manual-submission-of-data-file-for-ingestion). 

## Deployment Management Operations
