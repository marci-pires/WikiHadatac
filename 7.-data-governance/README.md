# 7. DATA GOVERNANCE

## Access Network

Communities of data users behind each HADatAc installation have their own rules on who can do what in terms of accessing, using and managing data. HADatAc uses an access network to capture and enforce these rules. [Section 7.1.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.1.-Access-Network) provides the instructions for a HADatAc administrator to build and maintain an access network.

## User Status, Categories and Access Permissions

Different users may have different permissions according to their roles \(categories\) and their current standing in terms of being registered or not with a HADatAc instance. [Section 7.2.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.2.-User-Status,-Categories-and-Access-Permissions) describes the possible status and categories of users, how they are pre-registered, and how they are granted access permissions.

## Data and Metadata Privacy

Every data point ingested into HADatAc has an owner. The user who uploaded the data is the owner of the data. The owner is responsible for assigning who can access the data, and can opt to share the data with other HADatAc users and even to make the data publicly available without any access restriction. It is also possible to share the data with _HADatAc users_ restricting data access to anyone who is registered with HADatAc. [Section 7.3.](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/6.3.-Data-and-Metadata-Privacy) provides the instructions for data owners and administrators to manage access to data.
