## 7.1.1. Access Network Elements

Every HADatAc has one access network composed of

* access levels and 
* users

HADatAcâ€™s access networks are initially composed of one default access level called **public**. Every user belongs to one access level, and is an access level on its own. For instance, if the access network is brand new, it only has the access level _public_. Therefore, if a new user _Carol_ is added, it is added under _public_. The figure above shows a more complete example of an access network where we see the node representing **Carol** pointing to the **pulic** node. This means that any data added by **Carol** to HADatAc will initially belong to **Carol** who will be the only user capable of accessing that data. If **Carol** needs to share the data, **Carol** can relax the restriction on the data by moving the access to the data to **public**.

On the same way that users are added to an access network, new access level can also be added. **Public** is the less restricted level of access in the access network and the further an access level with respect to _public_ the more restricted it the access level. In the figure above we see that three access levels have been added to our example network: **Project**, **Group A**, and **Group B**. We also see that both **Group A** and **Group B** are connected to **Project**, meaning that **Project** is the less restricted of these access nodes.

In terms of building an access network, we need to observe the following:

* Every access level must be connected to another access level \(and that **public** is a default access level available in any access network. This rule also implies that an access level cannot be connected to a user.
* Every user needs must be connected to an access level    

## 7.1.2. Access Vectors

Every user has an access vector. For instance, in the figure above, **Helen** has the following access vector: . That means that any data owned by **Helen** is assigned to be accessed only by **Helen** \(unless this rule is overwritten by the permission credentials in an OAS file being used to load **Helen**'s data\). From there, **Helen** can go to the data acquisition specification of her data and grant access to any of the levels in her access vector, including **public**.
