Metadata content is added into HADatAc through the use of online forms or through the uploading of metadata files. 

For each one of the metadata files below, we will identify their name convention, description, and possible error messages generated during their ingestion. Error messages are in the file's log that is displayed when selecting the "log" button on "HADatAc Home > File Management". 

## Types of Metadata Files
  
Five types of metadata files are used in HADatAc. A description on how how these files are structured, how they are named, and how they are constructed is available in [Section 5](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/5.-Metadata-Files).

## Ingestion Workflow

The exact way metadata files are fed into HADatAc may vary by study. 

Below, we describe a partial order of events that must be observed in automated workflows feeding metadata content into HADatAc:

* DPL files can be submitted any time after the knowledge graph bootstrap (see [Sec. 2.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap))
* STD files can be submitted any time after the knowledge graph bootstrap (see [Sec. 2.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap))
* SDD files can be submitted any time after the knowledge graph bootstrap (see [Sec. 2.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/2.2.-Knowledge-Graph-Bootstrap))
* An SSD file can only be submitted after its corresponding STD has been ingested 
* An OAS file can only be submitted after its corresponding DPL, STD, SSD and SDD files have been ingested

Although DA files are not metadata files, they should be considered in the content of study-ingestion workflows:  
* An DA file can only be submitted after its corresponding OAS file has been ingested 

In the tasks above, it is said that files are submitted and ingested meaning that automated workflows should be able to verify that the ingestion of a given metadata file submitted into HADatAc was successful. This verification can be done programmatically through the use of a RESTFul service.
