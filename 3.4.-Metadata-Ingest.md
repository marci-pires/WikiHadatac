Metadata content is added into HADatAc through the use of online forms or through the uploading of metadata files. 

For each one of the metadata files below, we will identify their name convention, description, and possible error messages generated during their ingestion. Error messages are in the file's log that is displayed when selecting the "log" button on "HADatAc Home > File Management". 

## 3.4.1. Types of Metadata Files
  
## 3.4.1.1. Deployment (DPL) Files

Name convention: Name starts with: __DPL-__. Ends with __.xlsx__

Used to include platform, instrument, detector and deployment information into HADatAc. The information in this kind of file tends to be study independent in the sense that platforms, instruments and detectors can be used in multiple studies. 

## 3.4.1.2. Study (STD) Files

Name convention: Name starts with: __STD-__. Ends with __.xlsx__ or __.csv__

Used to include one or more study basic information into HADatAc. Information in STD files include things like PI's name and address. Study's aims, short description and long description.

## 3.4.1.3. Semantic Study Design (SSD) Files

Name convention: Name starts with: __SSD-__. Ends with __.xlsx__

Used to specify and identify object collections related to studies. Subjects and samples are examples of such collections. Inter-relationship among object collections are also specified in SSD files. For example, if the main group of subjects are infants, and the group of parents is another group, SSD can specify the objects in both collections, and specify how parents are mapped to infants. Instructions on how to generate SSD files are available in [Section 4.3.1](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#431-semantic-study-design-sdd).

## 3.4.1.4. Semantic Data Dictionary (SDD) Files

Name convention: Name starts with: __SSD-__. Ends with __.xlsx__

Used to guide the process of ingesting file content into HADatAc databases. A single SDD file can be used to ingest the content from multiple files as long these files share the same content type.  Instructions on how to generate SSD files are available in [Section 4.3.3](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#433-semantic-data-dictionary-sdd). 

## 3.4.1.5. Object Access Specification (OAS) Files

Name convention: Name starts with: __OAS-__. Ends with __.xlsx__ or __.csv__

OAS files are to identify a common ‘prefix’ that is assigned to a given collection of data files. For instance, if File1.csv and File2.csv both can use SDD-Z.xls, then we can create an OAS file saying that ‘DA-Z’ is the prefix for SDD-Z.xls. In this case, we could rename File1 into DA-Z-1 and File2 into DA-Z-2 enabling the use of a common SDD to ingest both files.

OAS Files are also used to assign files to studies and to a given owner. Thus, we need an OAS file for each collection of files (including collections of 1 file) that share the same properties:
* Type of data content
* Owner
* Study that it belongs to

Instructions on how to generate OAS files are available in [Section 4.3.2](https://github.com/paulopinheiro1234/hadatac/wiki/4.3.-Metadata-Specification-(SSD,-OAS,-SDD)#432-object-access-specification-oas). 

Error messages:
- __"Error in DataAcquisitionGenerator: The specified owner email admin@hadatac.org is not a valid user!"__: this means that the email in the ACQ file does not match the email address of any user registered in HADatAc as described in Section 5.2.3.

### 3.4.2. Ingestion Workflow

The exact way metadata files are fed into HADatAc may vary by study. 

Below, we describe a partial order of events that must be observed in automated workflows feeding metadata content into HADatAc:

* DPL files can be submitted any time
* STD files can be submitted any time
* SDD files can be submitted any time
* An SSD file can only be submitted after its corresponding STD has been ingested 
* An OAS file can only be submitted after its corresponding DPL, STD, SDD and SDD files have been ingested
* An DA file can only be submitted after its corresponding OAS file has been ingested 

In the tasks above, it is said that files are submitted and ingested meaning that automated workflows should be able to verify that the ingestion of a given metadata file submitted into HADatAc was successful. This verification can be verified programmatically through the use of a RESTFul service.
